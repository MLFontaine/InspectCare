With over 9 years experience with children, currently offering daycare services. With over 20 different references (upon request) you can rest assure that your child/children will be in the EXCELLENT care. 

We are a family based daycare. Dedicating each and everyday to nourish young children's minds and hearts with love, as if they've never left home. 

Because we are family based, children here come in to their second home. They nap on beds not cots, they have breakfast, lunch and dinner at the kitchen table with all their friends, they learn to be kind to each other, to say please and thank you, to play together as friends and most importantly to be confident! Here we not only care for your children, but we try to teach them things that you as a parent would want to nourish upon your children. We understand that its hard enough going to work and having to leave them behind, so we offer services like text updates and picture updates. So that you can feel calm knowing that your children are doing wonderfully. 

Our daily routines include and are not limited to.. breakfast, story time, play time, potty time, lunch, nap time, sing song time, art time, ABC's and 123's and lots of hugs in between. 


Our days begin at 6am and end at 8pm (EXTRA HOURS ARE AVAILABLE) We also offer weekend and Overnight. (at an extra rate). Our children's ages range from 12 months - 5 yrs old.  



I am CPR certified, DayCare provider certified and Assistant Teacher certification for Pre-K and Kindergarden.

A list actress needs a live in/travel nanny asap! She has two young children, and needs someone who can do overnights as well as travel when she has work obligations. She is looking for a nanny who has at last 5 years recent, full time experience working as a full charge nanny. You should be totally hands on: be able to pack for trips, research age appropriate activities in the cities you are visiting, and help with anything else related to the children (making or sourcing healthy meals, keeping up with laundry, making sure there are enough diapers when you are on the road etc.)

This is such a FUN family, and a great opportunity to work for a High Profile client. You must have a Valid Passport, and clean driving record. You may be asked to drive when they are in smaller cities (no driving in Manhattan.)

Exceptional Nanny/babysitter available for part-time childcare


Recently my nanny has gone to a part time schedule
given my littlest daughter entered kindergarten.  She is looking to supplement working with our
family with other babysitting job(s). Her availability is M-F, 7:00 am-1:00 pm. 
Ideally she would like something regular, 2-5 days per week, but ad hoc is not out of the question.  Additionally, she is available for errands, organizing, and other tasks to ease your day to day. 

A little note about our Nanny. She has worked with us for 8 years.  My three daughters, ages 10, 9, and 5, adore her and are extremely attached.   She is kind, caring, responsible, fun, yet appropriately
stern when needed.  Childcare is not a part time gig for her.  Prior to working
with our family, she worked for another family and a day care for a few years.  We trust her explicitly with our children, 2 dogs, vehicle, personal documents, etc.  I think the world of our Nanny and have NO hesitation referring her.

Lituania's Bio

Hello Parents. I'm a very loving, honest and responsible woman. Why I love to be a nanny? There's nothing in this world more fun than children. I love to teach them so many things and you don't imagine all the things we do on the table doing arts & crafts or when the girls want to do a dress up show or when they start saying their first words in Spanish. They truly fulfill my heart. When you do what you love, it's not a job, it's a blessing.

Jasmin's Bio

Hello! My name is Jasmin. I am a very artistic and creative person. I am 20 years old and I'm a nursing student at New York City College of Technology. I have worked in a daycare as a summer job before, working with children 6 years old playing with them, giving them snacks, taking them to trips to the park and library. I also occasionally babysat my cousins, which is where I gained most of my experience. For one of my cousins I watched over 3 of her children since I was in the 8th grade (ages are 15, 8, and 5 now). My other cousin I babysat her daughter at my house for really late nights, she is 8 years old now, but I watched her when she was a toddler (1-2 years old). I have also volunteered in a school being a teacher's assistant for a kindergarten class grading, testing, and helping the students out with class work, reading, writing, math. I have experience working with other families.    "

Morning Caregiver to get children ready for school and walk them,https://newyork.craigslist.org/brk/kid/d/morning-caregiver-to-get/6307273140.html,Greenpoint,"
        
Hello,
I am looking for someone who can care for and help my competent and happy 6 and 10 year olds get to school in the morning. I would need someone to arrive at 5:30 am and they would be done as soon as the children were dropped at school between 8 and 8:30 am. The school is just a few blocks from our home so no transportation is necessary, just walking. I need someone Monday through Friday. The 6 year old may need some help getting dressed and they will both need breakfast. I am looking for someone who is happy, prompt, responsible and enjoys the company of young children. I will need references as well but do not need a professional nanny. I would be happy to help out college students with babysitting experience also. Please let me know if this arrangement interests you and send along salary requirements with your response. I look forward to hearing from you!

We are looking for sitters to join our community for PART TIME work. We are particularly interested in meeting sitters who have newborn/infant experience and available to work weekends. You will need at least 3 references, with a minimum of 2 being childcare references. We have wonderful families looking for regular sitters and offer opportunities to sit for some families in the top hotels in the city.

HOLA! :) HELLO! :)
Welcome to our post about Little Steps Day Care!

Little Steps Day Care (LSDC) is licensed by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. We aim to provide a safe, nurturing and optimistic Early Learning environment for your child/ren. 

A little about us:

*We are bilingual (English and Español)
*We've been open for 6 years and have a second facility opening soon
*Staff is CPR and First Aid certified
*Our staff is also CDA (Child Development Associate) certified
*Nutritional meals are served daily. Only fresh products are used and all food is prepared on site
*Our hours of operation are 8am-6pm...Hours may be altered by verbal or written agreement between provider and parent
*Accept children from the age of 3months to 12 years old
*Provide developmentally appropriate activities for every child
*We accept HRA ,ACS and PRIVATE  
*Local after school pick-up provided 
*Trips are planned during school breaks and vacations 

A small look at our philosophy:

-We are aware of the importance of cleanliness and the major role it plays in our children's health. We make it a priority to provide an atmosphere that promotes health, prevents illnesses and teaches children healthy and safe practices towards wellness from a young age. 
-We create weekly plans utilizing observational data to support goals for both individual and group children. Schedules include a balance of learning experiences and activities that provide opportunities for children to interact with one another and the outside world, develop their senses and stimulate their mental and physical growth.
-We believe in developing a warm, positive, supportive and responsive relationship with each child. Getting to know who they are not only aides in providing the best care, but it helps us assist each child in learning about their individuality and cultural identities allowing a sense of pride in them to flourish. 
-We believe in a program that incorporates the essence of togetherness within providers and families. One that encourages the cooperation of the children's families and provides them different means of communication and resources.

Our daycare aims to provide top quality in-home child care services and a welcoming atmosphere for both children and families. 
We'd love to hear from you! Give us a call or send us an e-mail for more information and to set up a tour.

Good Day,

How are you? I am hoping to find a long term live-in nanny position with a wonderful family. Offering 15+ years experience and proficiency in assimilating into a new family culture. Skilled in creating schedules, following commitments and maintaining routines. Bringing a compassionate childcare approach and exceptional child development skills to contribute to the family. My years of experience and training have fostered my ability to develop close relationships with both children and families. I have excellent communication skills, relate well to people and converse in a polite and courteous manner. I have a can do attitude and take great pride in everything I do. 

My experience has been working with families in New York City, Southampton, Long Island and Massachusetts. My last live-in nanny position was in Framingham, MA. I stayed with the family for eight wonderful years. Caring for a very sweet boy who was three years old when I arrived. At this present time he is starting his second year of college. I'm so proud of him!

I have found my nanny profession to be a very rewarding experience. I love to watch children learn and grow, while teaching them kindness, sharing, compassion and love. Always learning from children I'm working with everyday. I admire children's endless energy, honesty, creativity, flexibility and resilience. Knowing that my job is to help children achieve their full potential and help them feel good about themselves, brings a huge smile to my face.

I am a well mannered, articulate and responsible nanny with a great deal of experience and interest in children and their development. A confident child carer who is loving and devoted to her job.
Working with children is my true passion. When you are doing something you love, you truly shine. I always go above and beyond in my job. I hope to build a strong relationship and trust with my next family. With a strong foundation and open communication, the children can have an exceptional nanny as they grow and mature.

Some of my core competencies are being reliable, patient, trustworthy, organized and creative. A wonderful cook who has a passion for preparing and cooking healthy food. Also very, flexible with my time. I will be happy to help with light housekeeping and errands need be. I do have my own car with a great driving history.

I can provide you with references upon request and answer any questions you may have. Thank you very much for your time!
Please feel free to email me at your convenience. I will get back to you as soon as possible.

All the best to you and your family!

Renaissance Manny / Male Nanny Available,https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/kid/d/renaissance-manny-male-nanny/6314354182.html,Upper West Side,"
        
If you've been searching for a nanny or babysitter here and you're hoping to find someone more educated, more experienced, and maybe a little more savvy than the status quo, then I'm your guy.

First, some highlights:
-- Highest honors in dual bachelor's degrees from a top-five art school. [education & sculpture]
-- Ivy League graduate study in education.
-- Graduate of well-known boarding preparatory high school. Served as prefect for two years.
-- Former nanny for two boys from a high-profile family in the financial district.
-- Former teacher in both private and public school settings, largely in gifted education.
-- Completely fluent in spoken and written French.

As for the Renaissance element: I play several instruments, I'm involved in the visual arts, and I used to be on an MTV program. All of these have made me a good fit for kids who think they're ""too cool"" for a nanny, by the way.

In addition, I practice a martial art, I'm active in athletics, and I'm a firm believer in spending time with children outdoors (just like Rousseau). I've published several papers on child development in peer-reviewed journals. I'm a natural autodidact and truly enjoy sharing my love of learning with my charges.

I have experience with both full- and part-time arrangements, and I'm open to either. I work well with all children, including tweens/teenagers, children with learning and behavioral differences, and introverted or otherwise unique kids. Being a male nanny is much more than a job for me--it's a testament to my deep interest in education and child development.

All of the above is detailed in my résumé, and I come with fantastic references, so send me an email and let's discuss the particulars of your situation!

I'm very much looking forward to hearing from you.

My typical day would consist of going to the library for reading flash cards and socialization. Can take to the museum and the park weather permitting. I can teach Spanish if you'd like. Looking to work in many places. Williamsburg Park Slope UWS LES East Village etc.


My schedule is:

Mondays off

Tuesday's thru Fridays available until 2:30pm.

Available most weekends too.

I'm a warm college educated woman who has a passion for all children and I'm fit and cook healthy meals.

Warm regards, Lee    "

Hi,

We are a professional couple with a ten month old baby located in Mamaroneck, Westchester and are seeking a full-time nanny. We are wondering if there are any other families who may need part or full-time care (can be flexible) and are interested in a nanny share, to help alleviate costs and provide the children with companionship.

I will be happy to host in my home, as I mainly work from home and can provide an additional level of supervision.

We have not yet found a nanny, so we can potentially search for one together as well.

My name is Lee and I'm a Life Skills Coach for Special Needs children. I'm bilingual English and Spanish and have AED first aid and CPR. I also have a current background check. I am looking for part time work with a toddler or younger as I have experience with these kids also. 

Right now I'm working with 2 children in Windsor Terrace in the mornings and tomorrow will be my last day. One goes back to school and their regular Nanny will pick him up. Currently looking to help another family.

My typical day would consist of going to the library for reading flash cards and socialization. Can take to the museum and the park weather permitting. I can teach Spanish if you'd like. Looking to work in many places. Williamsburg Park Slope UWS LES East Village etc.


My schedule is:

Mondays off

Tuesday's thru Fridays available until 2:30pm.

Available most weekends too.

I'm a warm college educated woman who has a passion for all children and I'm fit and cook healthy meals.

Warm regards, Lee    "

Have a newborn & need some sleep? Qualified night nanny w/references.,https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/kid/d/have-newborn-need-some-sleep/6313297568.html,Upper East Side,"
        
My name is Alisha and I'm looking for a short term or occasional position as a night nanny. 

I'm 33 years old and I have been working with children of all ages since I took babysitting classes at twelve. Since then, I have worked in almost every kind of job involving kids, from a camp counselor, to a mother's helper, to working in a special care family court drop-in daycare center. I have experience with the Montessori method and specialize in infant and toddler care.

For the past 2.5 years, I have been a live-in nanny for a family with an almost 3 year old boy who is on the autism spectrum. I assisted them temporarily with postpartum care at 7 weeks and they offered me my position from there. Because he's getting older and his care needs are changing, I find myself looking to help like I was able to do with them. Pregnancy can be tough on everyone and through my experiences, I've created a toolbox of information that can help others. I don't have all the answers, but I certainly like to try. Of note, I have experience with postpartum depression and anxiety, as well as understanding and compassion for almost any situation. Many people go through it, but you don't have to do it alone.

You can rely on me for loving and attentive full night care of your child, including diapering, feeding, putting to sleep/soothing, reading to, and if needed, administering medications such as breathing treatments or topical ointments (no syringe medication). I'm a night owl who often isn't tired until 3 or 4 anyway. I prefer to be able to rest in the room if the baby is sleeping anytime between 2a and 7a (if I doze, I'm a very light sleeper), but am willing to be awake. 

I'm also available to help with any pre-birth preparations, especially for those on bed rest, either short or long term. This includes running errands, assembling baby furniture, offering suggestions on supplies, accompanying on appointments, and even laundry, light cleaning, bathing/clothing assistance, and overall company and/or support.

I'm CPR and First Aid certified (including infant) since 1998. I also have my associates and have had multiple child development and care trainings over the course of my career. 

I'm available 5p-9a, but I am willing to discuss some fluctuation in hours. I'm available up to 3 days a week and there is a 4 hour minimum. If leaving between midnight and 6a, I would require a car home. My usual babysitting rate is $20/hr for one child and with this being an on-demand, evening/overnight position, my rate would be a bit more, which I'm willing to discuss. I don't want to break the bank for folks and I enjoy helping, but I also have to make it worth the schedule flipping it can entail, such as last minute needs.

I have references and am willing to meet during the week in the afternoon or evening for interviews. Thank you for taking the time to read this and please don't hesitate to email me with any questions.    "

Seasoned guitarist, bassist and multi-instrumentalist. Teaching Guitar, bass, uke, vocals, mandolin, piano, theory, songwriting, pro tools, logic, cubase, ableton live, etc....with 20 + years of experience recently moved to CT from NYC. 
Played with people like Tito Puente Jr., Lucie Arnaz and Bette Midler.

Teaching all styles including Jazz, rock, blues, reggae, pop, folk, bluegrass, classical etc......finger style, picking, slap, etc....

Years in public and private schools. 
Songwriter, audio engineer and performance credits from major venues in LA, NYC, CT and many more. Toured in multiple bands and have been teaching since I was 18. I am 34 years old, respectful and professional and very good at what I do:)
In home lessons (I come to you)
$50 per hour lesson or
$80 for a two hour lesson


My guitar teachers had various styles, but the best ones actually asked me what ""I Wanted"" to learn and found ways to teach me, but also added a healthy dose of hard theory based practice that ""I didn't know I needed"". 

The worst ones simply gave me exercises to do and hurried me out of the room to get a paycheck. 

I truly care about sharing my knowledge and making my students better and creating an environment where they can explore their strengths and weaknesses. 

I love to teach and am very good at it. Feel free to ask me any questions you have and check out my playing here.

Rock & Roll Manny (Nanny and Babysitter),https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/kid/d/rock-roll-manny-nanny-and/6311986771.html,Lower East Side,"
        
I'm a little less Mary Poppins and a little more School of Rock. More responsible, more experienced, and much cooler than your average manny.

I'm a good fit for kids and parents who think a bit differently. I do have a magna cum laude degree in education, postgraduate study at Columbia, and I've been a nanny for two great families here in the city. But I also listen to lots of music and play bass, guitar, and drums. I draw, play video games and paintball, and play several sports.

Going to the skatepark, jamming with your child on a new song we're learning, and taking him/her and their friends to all-ages afternoon shows are my kind of activities. Of course, this comes alongside the traditional stuff: I can help in all school subjects, I speak three languages, and I know my way around the city, the online world, and the library equally well. Love museums and galleries. Great at handling drama and ""kid crises."" Good with smart kids, unusual kids, and cool kids (all the same thing, as far as I'm concerned).

Best suited for ages 6 and up. Email for further details, including my resume and references.    "

Exceptional Nanny/babysitter available for part-time childcare


Recently my nanny has gone to a part time schedule
given my littlest daughter entered kindergarten.  She is looking to supplement working with our
family with other babysitting job(s). Her availability is M-F, 7:00 am-1:00 pm. 
Ideally she would like something regular, 2-5 days per week, but ad hoc is not out of the question.  Additionally, she is available for errands, organizing, and other tasks to ease your day to day. 

A little note about our Nanny. She has worked with us for 8 years.  My three daughters, ages 10, 9, and 5, adore her and are extremely attached.   She is kind, caring, responsible, fun, yet appropriately
stern when needed.  Childcare is not a part time gig for her.  Prior to working
with our family, she worked for another family and a day care for a few years.  We trust her explicitly with our children, 2 dogs, vehicle, personal documents, etc.  I think the world of our Nanny and have NO hesitation referring her.
Please know that when you respond to this,  You will be speaking with My Nanny!    "

Hello Parents!

First, a little about myself. Im 24 years of age, educated & YES I am certified to take care of children! I enjoy working with children, which is why I have about 5 years working in daycares, and home babysitting. As I said before I am certified, along with CPR/First aid as well. I have a background check and have been finger printed also so your little one(s) are in good hands. I work anywhere in the Bronx or Manhattan. I am looking for a part time or full-time babysitting/nanny position. I work with children of ages, Infant to 12 yrs old. I also have experience with all types of children, For example, Adhd, handcap, autistic. 👍 I love writing and teaching children. I cant forget sports, I enjoy mainly baseball but Im always open to other sports too.  I hope this helped you get an idea about myself a little. 

Payments- I don't have a specific rate, I usually let the parents have a set rate or we work on it, but please keep in mind that I also won't work for any less than what my services deserve. 

PS, I'm Bilingual! I speak both English and Spanish. Thats always a plus! 

Thank you for reading! Good luck on your babysitter hunt!!    "

Hello!

I am a high school English teacher who is interested in tutoring weekday evenings.

I have taught all levels of high school English for over 20 years, but also have some middle-school English experience. I have taught college classes as an adjunct, as well. I possess a Master's from Teachers College in English Education and am certified to teach English K-12. Over the years, I have worked with and tutored students of all ages and ability levels. I have also taught multiple SAT Verbal courses, as well as COOP and TACHS test prep.

I am able to assist students with writing, reading comprehension, and/or vocabulary skills; I am also equipped to prepare a teenager for the ACT/SAT verbal sections or the ACT/SAT English test. 

I take tutoring as seriously as I take my full-time teaching job and always show up fully prepared.  

My rate is $65/hr. Upon request, I can provide my resume and/or references from my department chair and principal. 

Please let me know if you would like to arrange a meeting.

Best,
Kitty    "

I also have a wide set of organization skills, and have arranged and kept track of appointments and meetings for both parents and children.  

My first language is English, my second language is French, and I have an ESL-Teaching certificate. I can tutor French, English, and math, and have no allergies to any animals and am available as well for pet-sitting or dog-walking. I love animals! I also have experience as a Mother's Helper for when you just need that extra help with the kids. 

In addition, I have a BA from Hunter College. 

I live in Queens, and I am willing to travel to Manhattan and Brooklyn. I'm looking for about 25 hours a week, somebody needing an escort to afterschool activies, homework help and the occasional nighttime sitter. I'm a writer in my free time so I have a flexible schedule.

Good Day,

How are you? I am hoping to find a long term live-in nanny position with a wonderful family. Offering 15+ years experience and proficiency in assimilating into a new family culture. Skilled in creating schedules, following commitments and maintaining routines. Bringing a compassionate childcare approach and exceptional child development skills to contribute to the family. My years of experience and training have fostered my ability to develop close relationships with both children and families. I have excellent communication skills, relate well to people and converse in a polite and courteous manner. I have a can do attitude and take great pride in everything I do. 

My experience has been working with families in New York City, Southampton, Long Island and Massachusetts. My last live-in nanny position was in Framingham, MA. I stayed with the family for eight wonderful years. Caring for a very sweet boy who was three years old when I arrived. At this present time he is starting his second year of college. I'm so proud of him!

I have found my nanny profession to be a very rewarding experience. I love to watch children learn and grow, while teaching them kindness, sharing, compassion and love. Always learning from children I'm working with everyday. I admire children's endless energy, honesty, creativity, flexibility and resilience. Knowing that my job is to help children achieve their full potential and help them feel good about themselves, brings a huge smile to my face.

I am a well mannered, articulate and responsible nanny with a great deal of experience and interest in children and their development. A confident child carer who is loving and devoted to her job.
Working with children is my true passion. When you are doing something you love, you truly shine. I always go above and beyond in my job. I hope to build a strong relationship and trust with my next family. With a strong foundation and open communication, the children can have an exceptional nanny as they grow and mature.

Some of my core competencies are being reliable, patient, trustworthy, organized and creative. A wonderful cook who has a passion for preparing and cooking healthy food. Also very, flexible with my time. I will be happy to help with light housekeeping and errands need be. I do have my own car with a great driving history.
I can provide you with references upon request and answer any questions you may have. Thank you very much for your time!
Please feel free to email me at your convenience. I will get back to you as soon as possible.

All the best to you and your family!

Hi

 I'm a Special Needs Nanny looking for more work. I have CPR AED and first aid training. I'm also bilingual English and Spanish and have been working with the same family in Park Slope 10 years. Also work with a toddler who is not Special Needs was working with a 10 month old who is sadly moving to another state. I am now available Mondays for date night 

I'm also available most weekends. I have 2 complete background checks as I work for 2 agencies and they require this to work with any child. Medicaid requires it. Also just got company evaluation where I was observed working with child and got great evaluation! I am warm and have a passion to see Special Needs children be more independent but also for any child to make progress, Right now with the toddler we are doing ABC's with flash cards and working on colors and matching cards and counting and he has done a lot of progress with everything I am teaching him and with his languages skills!

Looking forward to hearing from you,

**🍭🍼👶🏽 Stay AT HOME MOM IS BABYSITTING For You 💕🍭🍼**

If you reading this then you are in need of a babysitter. 
I am willing to babysit your child inside my house. I am taking on all ages of children including infants. 
I have a 1 1/2 old toddler son. He enjoys playing and having fun with other children. We also do learning and reading time as well. There are a ton of toys for play as well as educational here.
I am more than willing to set up nanny cams or do FaceTime so you can make sure that your child is in good hands.
I live across the street from a really big park and I take my son there every day to play. 

Who am I?
I am a 32 years old Hispanic/African American woman. I am employed with Delta Air Lines as a Reservation Specialist ✈️.  I am currently on extended leave because I have had some bad experiences with babysitters watching my son. A good babysitter is really hard to find. I prefer to stay at home until my child is able to communicate with me about what's going on in his day. I refuse to put my child in a day care. My husband works so I have the opportunity to stay home and take care of our child. 
 
I'm looking to help out a mom who's looking for reliable trustworthy childcare. 
I have state and federal background clearances and am more than willing to submit to a drug test if needed.

7Y experience in loving family European nanny/babysitter. Art/Craft te,https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/kid/d/7y-experience-in-loving/6307970759.html,manhattan,"
        
Hello. My name is Birute. 
I'm looking for a part/ full time nanny/babysitter job.
I speak English, Russian and Lithuanian, I also understand some Polish..

I was working (better to say I was in love with) for the family nearly 7 years (children of different ages, from the baby till 15 years old).
We were busy with interesting activities, 
developing imagination, taste, designing, drawing, playing ball, listening to fairy tales, 
eating a healhy and tasty meal, (children liked my cooking) so we became true friends and we are keeping in touch. 
I have excellent recommendations from this family. 

I am an architect, but for numerous years have been working with children of different ages and it has been wonderful! 
I have also studied children psychology for two years that has helped me too.
I have experience to work with sweet babies (New born-1 year) too, I own techniques of early development

If You don't have time with household chores, I can help You with it. 

I am loving, compassionate, polite, punctual. I love being part of children's lives and to create loving cheerful atmosphere. 
I can continue, but probably opinion of other people, who know me, is more important, so i will provide recommendations for your reference. 

Priority location would be Manhattan and areas, but it can be another place too, I'm flexible. 
My salary depends on a situation.it's flexible. 
I am available to discuss your expectations in an interview at your convenience. 
Looking forward to hearing from You soon. 

Thank You

Hello!

I am a working mom with a Monday-Friday 9-5 position. My weekends consist of lots of r&r and catching up on household chores 🙂 

Looking to make some extra income babysitting Friday evenings-Sunday evenings. If you need a sitter for a night out, a Saturday shift, or that big interview I am happy to offer my services. 

My home is Vegetarian/Gluten Free/Dairy Free but I will accommodate your child as I'm 10 years in and understand how finnicky little ones can be!

My home is a very safe and very clean environment where you can be comfortable knowing your child will be loved like my own while in my care. 

I encourage you to stop by, meet me and my family and add me on social sites so you can learn more about me! I will only take up to two children at a time as this is what space allows.

Baths, dinner and snacks provided if need be. I only ask you send your children with adequate diapers/formula etc as I don't have any small ones of my own. 

Ages newborn-10 years old. Rates negotiable!!!

The Learning centers are designed to help children develop and learn at their own pace. The day care is arranged to provide clear pathway for children to move freely from one area to another and to interact with different groups of children. Activities include music, art, language, library, blocks building, puzzles, table games and dramatic play. We also incorporate planned field trips to enhance curriculum.

DATE NIGHT SITTER AVAILABLE TOMORROW,https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/kid/d/date-night-sitter-available/6271945313.html,ALL KIDS,"
        
Hello everyone:

My name is Lee and I am currently a Special Needs Nanny for a child in Park Slope. I have been working with him for 10 years and I am available for date night sitting and overnights. I am available all day Monday's and on some weekends. I am bilingual English Spanish and have a complete background check as I worked for 2 agencies and now work for a 3rd. I am also a personal assistant in my spare time. Set up appointments, accompany to appointments run errands, like post office etc. I am very good on the phone in resolving issues been doing this for years!

I am warm college educated and have experience with children who are not on the spectrum. My goal is to enrich your child's life and to teach them something everyday. I would love to teach a child Spanish, proper Spanish no slang. I learned Spanish at home and English in school. Spanish opens up a whole new world for you!

I am very health conscious and love cooking healthy foods, and making healthy drinks. NO chips, NO fast foods, NO cola NO juice. Exercise is very important to me and would not mind doing Zumba with your children or outdoor activities. Anything to keep them active. I also love reading and can read to them in English or Spanish whatever you would like.

I have first aide training and CPR and AED. I also have experience with Diabetics and children with Down Syndrome. I know the signs of low blood sugar and how to handle the situation should it arise. I know how to check sugar with machine too and know about blood pressure etc. Recently got evaluated 2 times back to back and passed.

Looking forward to hearing from you, 

Lee    "

I am looking to become a Nanny😊,https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/kid/d/am-looking-to-become-nanny/6307172863.html,Upper East Side,"
        
Hello families,

I am here seeking a great nanny opportunity. The only thing is that I've never held an actual nanny position. I am seeking a family that goes off of my baby sitting experience and the energy I give off when I am in your presence for an interview.

I am 28 and helped raise my now 15 year old sister and now 4 year old brother. I have experience with infants to 12 year olds but I rather start my nanny experience with a family with a younger child. I have also been the baby sitter for family and friends of the family. I never knew where to begin with a nanny gig because most families or nanny companies required applicants to have at least one year of verifiable experience being an actual nanny. I have family and my mentor that's been in my life from 9 years old until now that is willing to speak with anyone about how I am with and/or around children.

If you would like to reach please do so an we can go from there.

Thank You    "

Lorna has been working with our family for 6+ years, ever since our first daughter was 9 months old. I'm hoping to find a loving, warm family that will benefit from her vast experience and warm spirit as much as we have.
She cares deeply about our children and has been a professional nanny for 20+ years. She has worked for us 50 hours a week but lighter hours when both kids in school. She knows the larger BOCOCA neighborhood well and all it has to offer.
L has also created an amazing network of friends for our girls and is infinitely trustworthy and responsible -- and loves and nurtured our kids like her own.

I will connect you directly if you are interested.

Thanks,

Seeking a responsible and nurturing nanny
3 Days of the week-from 3pm-6pm Tues/Wed/Thurs
Brief Description:
Get to house before kids (ages 7& 9) come home to do housekeeping . Bus arrives around 3:40.  Fix an after school snack, chat and about their day, etc. Go through backpacks with them and help with homework.  Making sure they get there homework done is a must.  Arrange some kind of outdoor play in the yard or at a playground when homework is done.  I'll need help with laundry and keeping the house clean and tidy. 

With that said, caring for my children will be your job, and I can't justify paying someone who may be talking & texting on their phone the entire time.  Please keep that in mind when responding to the ad.


$15/hour and references are a must.    "

QUEENS CENTER OF THE ARTS
at Innovations In Creative Arts offers an amazing After School Time Program.

From One day, to three days, five days, or all six days per week, children have the opportunity to learn through real creative activities with historical content. How many talents, inventors, brilliant people should they know about, be inspired by, relate to? People who look just like them and perhaps walked the same streets as they do now?

Not just babysitting, your child can choose between two major creative, martial arts, literary, science, cooking, performance arts, etc. activities each day and have the time to fully explore and engage in the learning process. Learning takes time, putting it all together and seeing the connection between things also takes time. At Queens Center of the Arts, that's what we're all about - Real Kids, Real Activities, Real Artists and Certified Professionals teaching, mentoring, and encouraging. 

Registration is now open for September. Visit the website or stop in and visit. Come see what we're all about and what makes our program unique and valuable.    "

QUEENS CENTER OF THE ARTS
at Innovations In Creative Arts offers an amazing After School Time Program.

From One day, to three days, five days, or all six days per week, children have the opportunity to learn through real creative activities with historical content.  How many talents, inventors, brilliant people should they know about, be inspired by, relate to?  People who look just like them and perhaps walked the same streets as they do now?

Not just babysitting, your child can choose between two major creative, martial arts, literary, science, cooking, performance arts, etc. activities each day and have the time to fully explore and engage in the learning process.  Learning takes time, putting it all together and seeing the connection between things also takes time. At Queens Center of the Arts, that's what we're all about - Real Kids, Real Activities, Real Artists and Certified Professionals teaching, mentoring, and encouraging. 

Registration is now open for September.  Visit the website or stop in and visit. Come see what we're all about and what makes our program unique and valuable.  

Summer Hours: Tuesdays - Fridays 2:00pm - 7:30pm; Saturdays 10:00 - 7:30pm
September - June:  Mondays - Fridays 2:00pm - 8:00pm; Saturdays 9:30am - 8:00pm

Safe, reliable, loving,
 fun, childcare. Crafts and learning.

I am versed in first aid/ infant..child adult cpr.

We do a craft everyday.
We have storytime reading twice a day.
We play outside, whether permiting.
I take kids on daily trips to local library, playcenters, local free events.

No one is in my home 5am-7pm, but children.

My rates are great.
I have tons of references.

I am available all hours (day & nights) and also provide infant care. Contact for rates.

My basic schedule is 7am-7pm (before or after those hours are slightly more)

My rates for daytime care are as followed:

Huge Sibling discount.
Will work out price with parents...i know childcare is a fortune at some places or you're not getting safe quality care from these ""Babysitters""!
I have a huge wonderful list of past children & parent references. If a babysitter cant give you atleast 10 non family references-BEWARE, something is very wrong. If they havent resided in the same dwelling consistly beware. If their bathroom or car is old & dirty, Beware. These are all signs of someone irresponsible.
 I invite people to look at my bathroom, kitchen, etc...it says alot about a person. If they open their door in pj's and hair a wreck, thats another sign to beware of. What I'm saying is ""Be selective"" Best way to figure out who a person is, is Facebook. Look them up and see how they interact with others and whos on their friends list, the comments they or their friends leave-SAY ALOT ABOUT WHO THEY ARE!  If they drive a crap box car-sadly they are watching kids for a few bucks and are broke.

If they havent resided in the same dwelling consistly beware. If their bathroom or car is old & dirty, Beware. These are all signs of someone irresponsible.
 I invite people to look at my bathroom, kitchen, etc...it says alot about a person. If they open their door in pj's and hair a wreck, thats another sign to beware of. What I'm saying is ""Be selective"" Best way to figure out who a person is, is Facebook. Look them up and see how they interact with others and whos on their friends list, the comments they or their friends leave-SAY ALOT ABOUT WHO THEY ARE!  If they drive a crap box car-sadly they are watching kids for a few bucks and are broke. 
Im not judgemental, just realistic!

Parents provide lunch or i will for an extra $2 a day

(Choice of pizza, all beef hotdog, white meat chicken tenders, burger or grill cheese served with fruit slices and a veggie portion)

I provide breakfast, 2-3 healthy snacks, water, juice per day...(parent permiting, a cookie or sweet a day)

I am not a tv person. Children are allowed tv in my home in morning between 7-9am for a half hr.

Parents must leave childs carseat or booster each day when dropping off child. I have a clean NYS license and new safe suv.
Parents must provide diapers, wipes n extra set of clothing each day.

 I am local to Express way, Rte 25, Rte 83, Rte 97 i am a a mile or less from each.

Safe, reliable, loving,
 fun, childcare. Crafts and learning.

I am versed in first aid/ infant..child adult cpr.

We do a craft everyday.
We have storytime reading twice a day.
We play outside, whether permiting.
I take kids on daily trips to local library, playcenters, local free events.

No one is in my home 5am-7pm, but children.

My rates are great.
I have tons of references.

I am available all hours (day & nights) and also provide infant care. Contact for rates.

My basic schedule is 7am-7pm (before or after those hours are slightly more)

My rates for daytime care are as followed:
$28 a day 8:00am-5pm full time.
Each half hour earlier or later is $1 more.
Huge Sibling discount.
Will work out price with parents...i know childcare is a fortune at some places or you're not getting safe quality care from these ""Babysitters""!
I have a huge wonderful list of past children & parent references. If a babysitter cant give you atleast 10 non family references-BEWARE, something is very wrong. If they havent resided in the same dwelling consistly beware. If their bathroom or car is old & dirty, Beware. These are all signs of someone irresponsible.
 I invite people to look at my bathroom, kitchen, etc...it says alot about a person. If they open their door in pj's and hair a wreck, thats another sign to beware of. What I'm saying is ""Be selective"" Best way to figure out who a person is, is Facebook. Look them up and see how they interact with others and whos on their friends list, the comments they or their friends leave-SAY ALOT ABOUT WHO THEY ARE!  If they drive a crap box car-sadly they are watching kids for a few bucks and are broke. 
Im not judgemental, just realistic!

Parents provide lunch or i will for an extra $2 a day

(Choice of pizza, all beef hotdog, white meat chicken tenders, burger or grill cheese served with fruit slices and a veggie portion)

I provide breakfast, 2-3 healthy snacks, water, juice per day...(parent permiting, a cookie or sweet a day)

I am not a tv person. Children are allowed tv in my home in morning between 7-9am for a half hr.

Parents must leave childs carseat or booster each day when dropping off child. I have a clean NYS license and new safe suv.
Parents must provide diapers, wipes n extra set of clothing each day.

 I am local to Express way, Rte 25, Rte 83, Rte 97 i am a a mile or less from each.

Wonderful Nanny Available!,https://newyork.craigslist.org/brk/kid/d/wonderful-nanny-available/6310758358.html,Brooklyn,"
        
Hello, We are moving, and the hardest part is leaving behind our nanny, Emelie. 
Emelie has taken care of our son for over 2 years, and I cannot recommend her more highly. Emelie is calm, kind, reliable, responsible, self-motivated, fun, and loving. 
Everyday, Emelie shows up on time and ready to take my son out to the park, to meet friends, play... she is the leader which is so great. My son has a great time, is fed healthy meals, is bathed, and napped by the time I get home. Emelie is a pleasure to be around, and I trust her completely. Also a bonus is that she knows lots of activities for babies and toddlers in Brooklyn Heights, Cobble Hill, Carroll Gardens, and Boerum Hill. She lives in Brooklyn and was never late for work even once.
Emelie is open to full or part time work (minimum 30 hours per week).

Thank you,

Hi,
I am a middle-aged mother of 2 great (grown) children, one is an NYPD officer and one is finishing her masters in education. I am semi retired and looking for something preferably from home but would also consider something outside the home. Maybe you're a teacher and you could use help grading papers or having me do something in your home to give you more time with your kids, Maybe you own your own business and could use help with phone calls, mailings etc. The holidays are right around the corner, could you use help with the holiday shopping, wrapping etc? You tell me how I could make your life a little easier. I am extremely honest, reliable and responsible, you would never have to worry about me in your home or me doing work for you in my home.I can make your life less hectic while making some extra cash for myself. Feel free to message me with any requests for help and maybe we can help each other! Please NO perverted and unwanted replies!! I am looking for safe and legitimate work! Thank you    "
ARE YOU EXPECTING & SEEKING AFFORDABLE CHILD CARE IN MURRAY HILL?,https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/kid/d/are-you-expecting-seeking/6302038908.html,Murray Hill,"
        
We are expectant professional parents Due in late January, seeking to meet similarly situated expectant parents to plan fora Nanny Share. 

We are posting this now because are learning how expensive trustworthy childcare is to secure. Because we both work long hours, it appears that most group childcare will be impractical for us. (Most childcare facilities close at 6pm or so.) The cost of a private nanny seems prohibitive and, perhaps, even undesirable. So we are seeking to meet other expectant parents who are in a similar situation and, perhaps, agree to share a nanny in the neighborhood. 

We live at 40th street and Second Avenue and looking to meet another family -very- close by to us: We are thinking of an area bounded north by 44rd Street and south by 37th Street, and from First Avenue to Third Avenue. We hope to meet a happy, thoughtful, professional married couple for this purpose.

Please write to us if this seems an arrangement you may be interested in. Please also feel free to share any information or advice on this subject that you may have. We would very much appreciate it.

Hello, I am a 30 year old woman from Queens very close to Manhattan and close to the 7 train. I have years of experience with childcare. My most recent family was with a babygirl since she was 3 months old till two years old. The parent is out of work so now I am looking for something new. I am available Full-Time Or Part-Time ( Very Flexible). I have experience with infants and older children as well with references available upon request. I really honestly enjoy the beauty of children and interacting with them. I love reading with them, singing, dancing playing play dough & whatever other toys they like as well as blowing bubbles :) I am very responsible, my mother was very careful with me as a child, as far as watching me so I would not get hurt and I am the same way with the children I watch. I am very attentive and hands on. . Special flat rates do apply. Please call me at

I am writing this on behalf of our previous full time nanny Durga, who worked with us from September 2015 until July 2017.

When Durga started with us, our toddler boy was six months old.     Then in May 2017 we had a baby girl, and Durga helped with both our toddler boy and our baby girl.

Durga is seeking a full time job as a live-out nanny in Manhattan.    She has CPR training from the American Heart Association, and has nanny training.     I can attest she was a loving, caring nanny for our two kids.       She took care of all the children's related work (children's laundry, food preparation, feeding, visits to the park and to the children's library, etc).     We hope Durga will continue to visit us on occasion to look up the kids, as my toddler boy has much affection for her.   

Durga can be reached directly via telephone or text message at

EXPECTING A BABY & SEEKING AFFORDABLE CHILD CARE IN MURRAY HILL?,https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/kid/d/expecting-baby-seeking/6292882974.html,Murray Hill,"
        
We are expectant professional parents, with our baby due in late January, seeking to meet similarly situated expectant parents to plan for a nanny share. 

We are posting this now because we are learning how difficult and expensive trustworthy childcare is to secure. Because we both work long hours, it appears that most group childcare (i.e. Tutortime, Goddard, Kindercare), will be impractical for us. (Most childcare facilities close at 6pm or so.) The cost of a private nanny seems prohibitive and, perhaps, even undesirable. So we are seeking to meet other expectant parents who are in a similar situation and, perhaps, agree to share a nanny in the neighborhood. 

We live at 40th street and Second Avenue and looking to meet another family -very- close by to us: We are thinking of an area bounded north by 44rd Street and south by 37th Street, and from First Avenue to Third Avenue. We hope to meet a happy, thoughtful, professional married couple for this purpose. 

Please write to us if this seems an arrangement you may be interested in. Please also feel free to share any information or advice on this subject that you may have. We would very much appreciate it. Thank you.

Hello Parents!

First, a little about myself. Im 24 years of age, educated & YES I am certified to take care of children! I enjoy working with children, which is why I have about 5 years working in daycares, and home babysitting. As I said before I am certified, along with CPR/First aid as well. I have a background check and have been finger printed also so your little one(s) are in good hands. I work anywhere in the Bronx or Manhattan. I am looking for a part time or full-time babysitting/nanny position. I work with children of ages, Infant to 12 yrs old. I also have experience with all types of children, For example, Adhd, handcap, autistic. 👍 I love writing and teaching children. I cant forget sports, I enjoy mainly baseball but Im always open to other sports too.  I hope this helped you get an idea about myself a little. 

Payments- I don't have a specific rate, I usually let the parents have a set rate or we work on it, but please keep in mind that I also won't work for any less than what my services deserve. 

PS, I'm Bilingual! I speak both English and Spanish. Thats always a plus!

Hi everyone

My name is Lee and I'm a Special Needs Nanny looking for more work in July. My regular kid will be at a sleep away camp. I have CPR AED and first aid training. I'm also bilingual English and Spanish and have been working with the same family in Park Slope 10 years. Also worked with a toddler who is not Special Needs and worked with a 10 month old who moved out of state. With the toddler it was all about the ABCs flashcards and lots of reading. With the baby it was about the same with reading and play groups. Trips to the park etc.

I have 3 complete background checks as I worked for 2 agencies and work with a third and they require this to work with any child. Background was passed 3/2017 Medicaid requires it. Also got company evaluation where I was observed working with child and got great evaluation! (will show you). I am a warm Nanny who has a passion for all kids not just special needs and love cooking healthy meals and exercising.

Hello everyone:

My name is Lee and I am currently a Special Needs Nanny for a child in Park Slope. I have been working with him for 10 years and I am available for date night sitting and overnights. I am available all day Monday and on some weekends. I am bilingual English Spanish and have a complete background check as I worked for 2 agencies and now work for a 3rd. I am also a personal assistant in my spare time. Set up appointments, accompany to appointments run errands, like post office etc. I am very good on the phone in resolving issues been doing this for years!

I am warm college educated and have experience with children who are not on the spectrum. My goal is to enrich your child's life and to teach them something everyday. I would love to teach a child Spanish, proper Spanish no slang. I learned Spanish at home and English in school. Spanish opens up a whole new world for you!

I am very health conscious and love cooking healthy foods, and making healthy drinks. NO chips, NO fast foods, NO cola NO juice. Exercise is very important to me and would not mind doing Zumba with your children or outdoor activities. Anything to keep them active. I also love reading and can read to them in English or Spanish whatever you would like.

I have first aide training and CPR and AED. I also have experience with Diabetics and children with Down Syndrome. I know the signs of low blood sugar and how to handle the situation should it arise. I know how to check sugar with machine too and know about blood pressure etc. Recently got evaluated 2 times back to back and passed.

Looking forward to hearing from you,

We are trying to help our wonderful nanny Maiya find a new family because we are relocating to Los Angeles. Maiya has been with us for 10 months since our son was 4.5 months old. She is loving, energetic, responsible, engaging and very flexible. This is our first child so I was nervous about leaving him with anyone but Maiya is truly amazing. Oliver adores her (as do we) and we trust her completely. Anytime we need help on the weekends or have to stay late at work Maiya is always there ready to help in anyway she can. She is terrific with kids of all ages--she was a pro when Oliver was a baby and has managed to keep up with him even now that he is a crazy running toddler. We absolutely want to make sure that she goes on to work for a family that appreciates all she brings to their children's and their lives. Please feel free to contact me  if you or anyone you know is in need she can start July 1st and maybe even a bit earlier. She can work in Manhattan between 9-5

Hello, We are moving, and the hardest part is leaving behind our nanny, Emelie. 
Emelie has taken care of our son for over 2 years, and I cannot recommend her more highly. Emelie is calm, kind, reliable, responsible, self-motivated, fun, and loving. 
Everyday, Emelie shows up on time and ready to take my son out to the park, to meet friends, play... she is the leader which is so great. My son has a great time, is fed healthy meals, is bathed, and napped by the time I get home. Emelie is a pleasure to be around, and I trust her completely. Also a bonus is that she knows lots of activities for babies and toddlers in Brooklyn Heights, Cobble Hill, Carroll Gardens, and Boerum Hill. She lives in Brooklyn and was never late for work even once.
Emelie is open to full or part time work (minimum 30 hours per week).

Hello!
My name is Miyah and I have been a nanny for going on six years now. I have cared for and helped raise two infants up to three years old. I now have a six month old and I'm looking to go back to work full time.
My daughter is in daycare full time during the week so Monday through Friday would be an ideal situation for me.
I'm a very hands on nanny. Children love me and take to me so well. Not only do I care for the babies I cook, clean and set up play dates for them to enjoy. I'm also very experienced with finding fun things in the area for children to do, no matter where you live.
I love arts and crafts for the babies, story time and educational games, whether I come up with them or they are provided.
I believe communfication is key and if there is anything you feel uncomfortable with I prefer you lay it out and we can get through it together. 
I'm open to new recipes, different ways of teaching the children or any classes that must be taken
Please give me a call and we can set up a time to meet.

Expectant Prof. Parents Due 1/19 Seek Same for Very Close Nanny Share,https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/kid/d/expectant-prof-parents-due-1/6290991847.html,Murray Hill,"
        
We are posting this now because are learning how expensive trustworthy childcare is to secure. Because we both work long hours, it appears that most group childcare will be impractical for us. (Most childcare facilities close at 6pm or so.) The cost of a private nanny seems prohibitive and, perhaps, even undesirable. So we are seeking to meet other expectant parents who are in a similar situation and, perhaps, agree to share a nanny in the neighborhood. 

We live at 40th street and Second Avenue and looking to meet another family -very- close by to us: We are thinking of an area bounded north by 43rd Street and south by 38th Street, and from First Avenue to Third Avenue. We hope to meet a happy, thoughtful, professional married couple for this purpose.

Please write to us if this seems an arrangement you may be interested in. Please also feel free to share any information or advice on this subject that you may have. We would very much appreciate it.

Seeking Au Pair/Nanny in Midtown East with Free Room Provided on UES,https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/kid/d/seeking-au-pair-nanny-in/6297510679.html,Midtown,"
        
We are looking for childcare starting in late February 2018 for an infant aged 6-8 weeks old. We live in Midtown East, but also have an apartment in a walk-up building on the Upper East Side. You would live in our Upper East Side place, rent free. You will have one of the bedrooms and access to a shared full kitchen & bathroom. The other room is occupied by a housemate, who is older, a professional, and very nice.
 
You would provide childcare during the day at our Midtown apartment. Hours will be around 10:30am to 7pm from Monday through Friday, with some flexibility for both us and for you. No service is required on weekends. 
 
Please get in touch with us if this interests you. In order for you to get a full sense of what the arrangement would be like, we would like to start with an in-person interview. This will give us both an opportunity to get to know each other, and also give you an idea of what it would be like living in the Upper East Side while working in Midtown -it is a very easy commute.

*Please include your contact information. Provide to us also your salary requirements or indicate your financial considerations, taking into account that a room is, or can be, provided for you. And please show in your email that you are aware that this position does not begin until February.  Without these within the email, we may not respond to you. Thank you!    "

"TUTOR: English Teacher, 10 years of exp, Master's of Ed from Columbia",https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/kid/d/tutor-english-teacher-10/6312143786.html,,"
        
Hello!

I am a high school English teacher who is interested in tutoring on weekdays.

I have taught 9th and 10th grade English for six years, but I previously taught middle school English for three years and have worked in elementary classrooms, as well. I possess a Master's from Teachers College in 1st-6th grade education. Over the years, I have worked with and tutored students of all ages. I have also taught multiple SAT Verbal courses.

I am most able to assist students with writing, reading comprehension, and/or vocabulary skills; I am also equipped to prepare a teenager for the ACT/SAT verbal sections or the ACT/SAT English test. In my past tutoring experience, I have also helped students with basic middle and grammar school math, science, history, and Spanish.

I take tutoring as seriously as I take my full-time teaching job and always show up on time and prepared.

My rate is $95/hr. Upon request, I can provide my resume and/or references from my department chair and principal. 

Please let me know if you would like to arrange a phone or in-person meeting.

Best,
Brooke    "

They also add that I have an innate motherly instinct and is easily able to follow guidelines. I have very good English and speak a total of 4 languages. I also am certified in First Aid, CPR and water safety. I would like you to know that educating your children is a priority for me and I will love them as if they were her own.

The home also has a central air conditioning system for the hot summer months, along with an enclosed backyard filled with swing sets, slides and tricycles. We will be eating lunch outdoors and having summer barbeques in our very own backyard.

My guitar teachers had various styles, but the best ones actually asked me what ""I Wanted"" to learn and found ways to teach me, but also added a healthy dose of hard theory based practice that ""I didn't know I needed"". 

The worst ones simply gave me exercises to do and hurried me out of the room to get a paycheck. 

I truly care about sharing my knowledge and making my students better and creating an environment where they can explore their strengths and weaknesses. 

I love to teach and am very good at it. Feel free to ask me any questions you have and check out my playing here.

Hi everyone


My name is Lee and I'm a Life Skills Coach for Special Needs children looking for more work. I have CPR AED and first aid training. I'm also bilingual English and Spanish and have been working with the same family in Park Slope 10 years. Also worked with a toddler who is not Special Needs was working with a 10 month old who is sadly moving to another state.

I'm available most weekends. I have a complete background check as I work for an agency and they require this to work with any child. Medicaid requires it. Also got company evaluation where I was observed working with child and got great evaluation! This was an important evaluation that went to my agency and forwarded to OPWDD the government office that handles people with disabilities! 

 I am warm college educated woman and have a passion to see Special Needs children be more independent but also for any child to make progress, with the toddler we did ABC's with flash cards and worked on colors and matching cards and counting.  He made a lot of progress with everything I taught him and with his language skills! Parent's were very impressed. I'm available for emergencies. Mornings and most weekends.

Looking forward to hearing from you,

Exceptional Nanny/babysitter available for part-time childcare


Recently my nanny has gone to a part time schedule
given my littlest daughter entered kindergarten.  She is looking to supplement working with our
family with other babysitting job(s). Her availability is M-F, 7:00 am-1:00 pm. 
Ideally she would like something regular, 2-5 days per week, but ad hoc is not out of the question.  Additionally, she is available for errands, organizing, and other tasks to ease your day to day. 

A little note about our Nanny. She has worked with us for 8 years.  My three daughters, ages 10, 9, and 5, adore her and are extremely attached.   She is kind, caring, responsible, fun, yet appropriately
stern when needed.  Childcare is not a part time gig for her.  Prior to working
with our family, she worked for another family and a day care for a few years.  We trust her explicitly with our children, 2 dogs, vehicle, personal documents, etc.  I think the world of our Nanny and have NO hesitation referring her.

My schedule is:

Mondays off

Tuesday's thru Fridays available until 2:30pm.

Available most weekends too.

I'm a warm college educated woman who has a passion for all children and I'm fit and cook healthy meals.

Warm regards, Lee    "

Hi there!

Thanks for stopping by. I'm a former NYC school teacher(graduate coursework in spcial education and reading development) I'm  an Upper West Side resident(fit and city savvy).  I have certification in CPR and I have fingerprint clearance(certificates for both). I would love to be part of your children's lives.
I've been babysitting since my teens. My babysitting experience has been with pre schoolers, but I can also help older children  interested in the arts- I'm an accomplished photographer.

I'm mature and responsible, but I also know how to have a good time with kids. I can help with homework, prepare a meal and get kids ready for bed.

I have a very flexible schedule. I can travel to your home or hotel within certain limits(reimbursement for carfare). 

Resume and references upon request.

Available ASAP. 

When replying please state: schedule, number and ages of children, and job
expectations.

Best,
Barbara

Sometimes life throws you a curve ball and you need childcare coverage fast!

Wee Care Sitters, (a subsidiary of Wee Care Nanny Agency, Est. 2001) can provide experienced, qualified, nurturing sitters and other domestic household help for a few hours to get you through a crunch or simply give you a break. On-call nannies are available for daycare closures, sick children, fill-in for an absent nanny, date night or any other temporary coverage need. Our experienced and dedicated temporary nannies are available 24/7. We also offer same day coverage for emergencies.

Rest assured that we use only our experienced nannies to fill any temporary babysitting positions. The philosophy behind this is simple- our professional nannies make the best sitters. Our temporary nannies are either supplementing their current full-time nanny position, interviewing for a permanent nanny position, or filling in prior to starting a new position.

I enjoy working with children, which is why I have about 5 years working in daycares, and home babysitting. As I said before I am certified, along with CPR/First aid as well. I have a background check and have been finger printed also so your little one(s) are in good hands. I work anywhere in the Bronx or Manhattan. I am looking for a part time or full-time babysitting/nanny position. I work with children of ages, Infant to 12 yrs old. I also have experience with all types of children, For example, Adhd, handcap, autistic. 👍 I love writing and teaching children. I cant forget sports, I enjoy mainly baseball but Im always open to other sports too.  I hope this helped you get an idea about myself a little. 

Payments- I don't have a specific rate, I usually let the parents have a set rate or we work on it, but please keep in mind that I also won't work for any less than what my services deserve. 

PS, I'm Bilingual! I speak both English and Spanish. Thats always a plus!

Responsible and Educated Manny / Male Babysitter  (Columbia intern),https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/kid/d/responsible-and-educated/6314018695.html,Union Square,"
        
Hello,

I am a college graduate currently working part-time here in the city as a mentor / manny (like an older brother) for an awesome Manhattan family. I'm looking to get more hours so am posting here in the hopes of meeting someone who needs family assistance.

I grew up helping in the classroom - my mom is a teacher - a while a senior in high school I was a tutor at the elementary school across the street. My aunts and uncles have also hired me to tutor and help with my cousins (e.g., school work, play dates, errands, etc.).

Below is a summary of my academic and professional qualifications (education, skills, and talents) as well as more information on my experiences.

-Bachelor's degree in the social sciences from top 35 university in the US
-Speak three languages: native English, fluent Portuguese, conversational Spanish
-Study abroad experience (full year in developing nation)
-Internship at Columbia University

As a manny, I've done light homework help; preparing snacks and basic meals/ordering dinners for the kids and I; helping clean up of messes; reading and educational activities; and fun games and related activities the kids enjoy--Legos, Star Wars, dinosaurs, imaginary games, board games, art and drawing/sketching, to name a few. I strive to create a stable, healthy, and fun environment for the kids and to set a good example and be an inspirational role model. I am a non-smoker, pet-friendly, and am flexible in scheduling.

Please reach out if you would like to know more, and tell me about yourself and what your needs are. The arrangement I am seeking would be a guaranteed 20 hours per week, preferably Monday to Friday sometime around 3 pm to 7 pm give or take. I would be available to help on school holidays and possibly a weekend here or there as long as we scheduled with advanced notice. The age range I am qualified to help with is first graders to teenage years, and I would only be comfortable with one to two kids. Because I live in Manhattan, I do not drive and so would be unable to function as a driver. My longer term goals are to attend grad school, but since that takes one to two years from applying, I'd be able to commit for one to two years, maybe more.

Lastly, what I am looking for in a family is what I offer as an assistant: trust, respect, generosity, and thoughtfulness. 

Thank you.    "

Hello, Welcome to Sunshine Daycare. My name is Vanessa Liang. I provide a family daycare that is exceptionally convenient, safe, fun for children of all ages. We have teachers and students in different ethnicities and they learn very well to cooperate with each other.  The teachers teach with pride and patience for the children to learn mannerism and develop social skills. I believe this will assist them to get a jump start in early life. We provide the children with daily healthy food, fun activities and learning environment in the classroom. We also do offer pickup service.  Our rates are very affordable and the best in the area. I have many references from our customers from providing outstanding service. Please feel free to contact me if you should have any questions. I look forward to speaking with you all.

My daycare hours are Mon-Fri 8am-6pm, with some flexibility if needed.
Our daily activities include: story time, arts and crafts, circle time, exercising, music and dance, outdoor fun in a nearby play area. We have weekly learning themes which include: science experiments, letters, numbers, shapes, colors, seasons, holidays, fire safety, friendship, and so much more.

I provide breakfast and lunch which are prepared daily, as well as afternoon snack. We are located in College Point, very close to Flushing.

We pick up after school from PS 29 and PS 129

We learn, play and have lots of fun!
Thank you,
Sunshine Daycare

Need a Sitter?,https://newyork.craigslist.org/stn/kid/d/need-sitter/6290917389.html,,"
        
Hello,

I am 26yrs old and a stay at home mom for my 2 little girls, a 20 month old and a 6 month old .  I have cared for children of all ages for over 10yrs and truly enjoy it.  I am seeking a child care position in my home because I love being home with my girls but my husband and I are in need of a second income.

A normal day for my girls and I would be having breakfast, lunch and dinner with 2 snacks inbetween.  I mostly purchase organic and snacks usually consist of fruit.  We love to play, dance around the house, read books and take walks when the weather is nice.  We do not have any pets and live in a one level home.

If you have any questions please email me and I will get back to you as soon as possible.    "
Loving nanny with years of experience and CPR training,https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/kid/d/loving-nanny-with-years-of/6314482012.html,Brooklyn,"
        



Dear Sir/Madam:

My name is Kenisia Facey, 33 years of age and of Jamaican nationality. I am legal to work and travel in and outside the United State. I also possess a N.Y State driver's license.
I am also CPR certified for infants children and adults.

I am seeking a Full-time Nanny position. 

I am a responsible, capable, reliable, non-smoking, energetic and self-motivated individual. I really enjoy working with children as their simple approach to everyday life intrigues me and offers me a chance to learn from them. I take my responsibilities very seriously and assure you of my honesty and integrity.

For over 8 years I have worked as a nanny. I have particular experience with newborns to 14 years of age and with multiple sets of twins. I have cared for children with special needs, medical conditions and food allergies. I also understand Jewish Dietary Laws and believe that my experience would make me a suitable applicant for the available vacancy. 
I hope you find my application of interest and I would be pleased to attend an interview at your convenience.

References are available on request. 

Yours sincerely

Kenisia Facey

Help for mothers who feel overwhelmed 

Hello I know you feel overwhelmed. Working & taking care of kids, you find yourself often anxious and worried. You feel as if there's not enough hours in the day to get it all done. Between the demands at work to the demands at home there's never any time for you. Yet you see some moms who seem to have it all the together the Martha stwarts of the world. How the heck do these women do it. Well it starts with a community of help. I want to start just such a community and I want to help mothers like myself figure out how to be their best selves. I'm on a journey of growth and finding happiness. I would love to help others get on their own journies. This may start small who knows if anyone will join in but, if you want help I'm here to offer it for free no money needed all you need to bring is just a willingness to except help and stay positive in your heart.

Hello!
My name is Miyah and I have been a nanny for going on six years now. I have cared for and helped raise two infants up to three years old. I now have a 14 month old and I'm looking to go back to work full time.
My daughter is in daycare full time during the week so Monday through Friday would be an ideal situation for me.
I'm a very hands on nanny. Children love me and take to me so well. Not only do I care for the babies I cook, clean and set up play dates for them to enjoy. I'm also very experienced with finding fun things in the area for children to do, no matter where you live.
I love arts and crafts for the babies, story time and educational games, whether I come up with them or they are provided.
I believe communication is key and if there is anything you feel uncomfortable with I prefer you lay it out and we can get through it together. 
I'm open to new recipes, different ways of teaching the children or any classes that must be taken
Please give me a call and we can set up a time to meet.

We are trying to help our wonderful nanny Maiya find a new family because we are relocating to Los Angeles. Maiya has been with us for 10 months since our son was 4.5 months old. She is loving, energetic, responsible, engaging and very flexible. This is our first child so I was nervous about leaving him with anyone but Maiya is truly amazing. Oliver adores her (as do we) and we trust her completely. Anytime we need help on the weekends or have to stay late at work Maiya is always there ready to help in anyway she can. She is terrific with kids of all ages--she was a pro when Oliver was a baby and has managed to keep up with him even now that he is a crazy running toddler. We absolutely want to make sure that she goes on to work for a family that appreciates all she brings to their children's and their lives. Please feel free to contact me  if you or anyone you know is in need she can start July 1st and maybe even a bit earlier. She can work in Manhattan between 9-5

NANNY SCARSDALE, NEW YORK

I'm a  former professional and I'm looking for a position as a Nanny Monday-Friday.  

I have a Bachelors Degree from Bernard Baruch College of The City University of New York. I worked as an Accountant in the Investment Department of a major pulp and paper company for 28 years. 

I worked as a Nanny Monday-Friday taking care of two boys ages 15 and 11 years old in Scarsdale from September 2015 - December 2016.

My duties were: Picking up both boys from school, drive them to and from activities, and help around the house in various ways.

I worked as a Nanny taking care of two boys ages 9 and 4 years old in Scarsdale from October, 2013 to June 15, 2015. My duties were: picking up both boys from school, serving them a snack, supervise outside activities (including play dates), drive them to and from activities, play and read with them, oversee the 9 year old homework, read to the 4 year old, and other age appropriate academic activities, and cooking supper.

Additionally, on date nights I gave the boys a bath, and read to the 4 year old at bedtime; the family returned to England June 2015.  

I'm  college educated, vivacious, kind, patient, responsible, honest, reliable, punctual, and an energetic person who is extremely fond of children of all age groups. I'm committed to nurturing the talents and strengths of each individual child.

I was also a Nanny for three children ages 3, 5 and 9 years old in Scarsdale; the family returned to France in 2013.

 I'm a non-smoker with my own transportation.

I can be reached at

 (ask for Janet) or via e-mail.

When's the last time you were able to read a book without a ""to-do"" list on your conscience?

I'm an accomplished PA hoping to serve a family that needs part-time assistance.  I'm currently listed with a top NYC staffing agency and have ten years of experience offering long-term service.  My references are stellar - nab me on Craig's List and save yourself the 15% gross salary fee! 

I'm warm, pleasant and pride myself on making my families happy.  If you know you could use a hand, but balk at the notion of bringing someone on board who'll require an orientation and will be privy to the specifics of your chaos - I'm your girl.  I'm a quick study and will work quickly towards a system that allows me to anticipate need.

I provide both on-site and virtual assistance - clients usually need a mix of both.  You'd have the freedom to offload tasks and requests 24/7 as they enter your head space and be assured that you're delegating to someone who will follow-through.  I'm sharing the standard list of tasks that I provide - it becomes more family-specific over time:
     
     Schedule and oversee home repairs
     Schedule and oversee home maintenance
     Purchase household equipment, supplies and services
     Purchase groceries
     Create and maintain organizational systems
     Liaise with household suppliers, vendors, colleagues, clients
     Manage personal calendar
     Manage personal correspondence (daily, holiday)
     Hire/ supervise/ support/ terminate staff (nannies, housekeepers, groundskeepers, tutors)
     Manage designated projects
     Manage personal appointments
     Arrange travel plans/ itineraries/ accommodations
     Arrange dinner reservations
     Assist with event/ party planning
     Assist with personal shopping (errands, gifts, holidays)
     Prepare and oversee mailings
     Assist with bill payment

To Any Parents Searching For a Wonderful Nanny!,https://newyork.craigslist.org/brk/kid/d/to-any-parents-searching-for/6315691381.html,New York City,"
        
I would like to recommend our wonderful nanny of 8 years who is looking for a new, full-time live-out position in NYC, preferably in Brooklyn.

She is extremely competent with newborn and very young children as well interactive and positively reinforcing in her interactions with older children. A very caring & loving person (our kids adore her) she was very reliable in all of her domestic responsibilities, such as cooking, light cleaning, doing the laundry, etc.  Essentially, she has been responsible for raising my two girls while they were growing up and I was preoccupied with my business during the work week. 
If you are looking for a mature, trustworthy, warm and sincere caretaker, you will love our nanny! 

Please feel free to contact me if you or anyone you know is in need; she can start immediately.  I would be happy to speak in more detail about her qualifications and will pass along her contact info for an interview. 

Thank you!

Our wonderful nanny Julliet has been a with our family for the past nine years! 
She came to us when our daughter was five months old. She has helped us raise a wonderful nine-year girl as well as caring for our son who is now five and about to enter kindergarten. She has been a devoted, dependable and trusted nanny to our children, and an irreplaceable part of our family. My children absolutely adore her and she has immeasurably helped me as a working mom. When I leave my house in the morning, i don't think twice about my children's well-being or happiness. I trusted Julliet completely and she will be missed terribly.

We made a decision to move to Westchester, so we would love to find a wonderful family for our Julliet.

Nanny Phones,https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/kid/d/nanny-phones/6316692802.html,New York,"
        
I'm interested in speaking to parents about how they balance the issue of nannies using cell phones while watching their children. In some cases, parents have forbidden nannies from using the phone during work hours, or photographing their children, although it's impossible to oversee. I'm open to speaking with both parents and nannies.

I'm a writer working on an essay about the topic. All names will be kept confidential.
