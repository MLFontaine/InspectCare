AHLOOOOHAAAA!!!

It is a pleasure to meet you via the internet! Say's who? Crystal Violet. I have cared for infants, toddlers, preschoolers and middle school aged kids students in child care programs, public schools, private schools and summer camps. I have worked at Bright Horizon as an Assistant Teacher nurturing infants, helping them with tummy, play, read and sleep time. Previously I worked as a Para where I catered to one student and guided the class on daily meditations. I have mentored groups of students on meditations, nature walks and art activities between the ages of 3-12 at OASIS Summer Camp, Children's Art & Science Workshop Camp, Don Pedro Albizo Campus Public School and Kipp Infinity Charter School. I am now looking to build healthy relationships with children in the comfort of their homes. If you are looking for someone to help your kids with light homework, yoga, meditation, art activities, light meals and light cleaning after children...well then I always say if it's meant to be then it's meant to be. Preferably I would like to care for children between 6 months- ten years of age up to three children in total. If this resonates with you we can go into details and I can forward you my resume and we can have a talk via skype or any other video chat.

Ciao!    ",b

You have a babysitter and you have a housekeeper.  It should be easier, but it's not.  Everyday your ""to-do"" list grows - and you mean well, but it's never really addressed in a timely manner.  Friday night rolls around, the kids are loved up, bathed and in bed - but instead of breathing a sigh of relief and relaxing into the weekend you turn to the list and realize just how many errands you're going to be running in addition to the usual onslaught of Saturday/Sunday kiddo activities.  It might be a fun weekend, but what you need is the opportunity to pause and recharge.  It's not going to happen because you're going to be buying groceries, shopping for gifts, wrapping gifts, finding items for your child's project, hunting down stuff your housekeeper needs, locating items that your babysitter wants, managing whatever it is that your husband lovingly put on your plate, researching the thing that your mom asked you about and sorting out calendar conflicts.

My clients in the past have come from three camps - busy professionals with families working high-net, time-intensive jobs that require a tremendous amount of focus and don't allow for a relaxed, comfortable handling of house management, single professionals who don't have families but have business-related social commitments that don't allow them to tend to household matters and busy couples for whom philanthropy, travel and community development are the primary focus of their time. 

My appeal today is to the first category - any working mom who would appreciate mental relief and the ability to be more present.  My references are stellar and would assert that I add value - I'll take on errands, tasks and the minutiae that accumulates daily.  My work is provided both on-site and off - and my clients are encouraged to offload tasks from their head space to mine 24/7 via email with the guarantee that they'll be handled in a timely manner.  I'm warm, fun, quietly efficient and charmingly tenacious- I can be trusted to act on your behalf in a way that wins admiration for you and your ""brand.""

Contact me so that we can have a chat about the frustrations you're experiencing and how I might be helpful.  I have a 10-hour weekly minimum, but you'll find that just 10 hours of my time will make a tremendous difference in your time-crunched life!    ",b

Safe, reliable, loving,
 fun, childcare. Crafts and learning.

I am versed in first aid/ infant..child adult cpr.

We do a craft everyday.
We have storytime reading twice a day.
We play outside, whether permiting.
I take kids on daily trips to local library, playcenters, local free events.

No one is in my home 5am-7pm, but children.

My rates are great.
I have tons of references.

I am available all hours (day & nights) and also provide infant care. Contact for rates.

My basic schedule is 7am-7pm (before or after those hours are slightly more)

My rates for daytime care are as followed:
$28 a day 8:00am-5pm full time.
Each half hour earlier or later is $1 more.
Huge Sibling discount.
Will work out price with parents...i know childcare is a fortune at some places or you're not getting safe quality care from these ""Babysitters""!
I have a huge wonderful list of past children & parent references. If a babysitter cant give you atleast 10 non family references-BEWARE, something is very wrong. If they havent resided in the same dwelling consistly beware. If their bathroom or car is old & dirty, Beware. These are all signs of someone irresponsible.
 I invite people to look at my bathroom, kitchen, etc...it says alot about a person. If they open their door in pj's and hair a wreck, thats another sign to beware of. What I'm saying is ""Be selective"" Best way to figure out who a person is, is Facebook. Look them up and see how they interact with others and whos on their friends list, the comments they or their friends leave-SAY ALOT ABOUT WHO THEY ARE!  If they drive a crap box car-sadly they are watching kids for a few bucks and are broke. 
Im not judgemental, just realistic!

Parents provide lunch or i will for an extra $2 a day

(Choice of pizza, all beef hotdog, white meat chicken tenders, burger or grill cheese served with fruit slices and a veggie portion)

I provide breakfast, 2-3 healthy snacks, water, juice per day...(parent permiting, a cookie or sweet a day)

I am not a tv person. Children are allowed tv in my home in morning between 7-9am for a half hr.

Parents must leave childs carseat or booster each day when dropping off child. I have a clean NYS license and new safe suv.
Parents must provide diapers, wipes n extra set of clothing each day.

 I am local to Express way, Rte 25, Rte 83, Rte 97 i am a a mile or less from each.

Hello Parents!

First, a little about myself. Im 24 years of age, educated & YES I am certified to take care of children! I enjoy working with children, which is why I have about 5 years working in daycares, and home babysitting. As I said before I am certified, along with CPR/First aid as well. I have a background check and have been finger printed also so your little one(s) are in good hands. I work anywhere in the Bronx or Manhattan. I am looking for a part time or full-time babysitting/nanny position. I work with children of ages, Infant to 12 yrs old. I also have experience with all types of children, For example, Adhd, handcap, autistic. 👍 I love writing and teaching children. I cant forget sports, I enjoy mainly baseball but Im always open to other sports too.  I hope this helped you get an idea about myself a little. 

Payments- I don't have a specific rate, I usually let the parents have a set rate or we work on it, but please keep in mind that I also won't work for any less than what my services deserve. 

PS, I'm Bilingual! I speak both English and Spanish. Thats always a plus! 

Thank you for reading! Good luck on your babysitter hunt!!    ",b

The classroom is divided in learning centers; Art, Science/Technology, Music, Blocks, Dramatic Play, Manipulative, and Library.

THE INTERACTIVE BRAIN BOOK:
Fun Learning for Science Lovers

...and enjoy its dynamic, fast-paced book trailer here-> 



Affordable.  Soon Available in Hard Cover, Soft Cover and
all Digital Formats.
This is the beginning of a lifetime science adventure for your children...
pictorial, serious, humorous, with lots of interactive elements, so it's not 
only reading, there's something for your young readers to do on every page.

And there's even a Graduation ""ceremony"" for young readers plus
a rhyming Graduation Song.

and hang up.  These are suitable for kids to hang up in their
rooms, for Science Teachers to post on school bulletin boards,
for Medical School Libraries to post, for Neuroscientists
to hang in their Laboratories, and so forth.

These Posters are both instructive and humorous. While the book
itself engages and challenges a child's mind to learn all about
the wonderful human brain and perhaps, some day, to work in
healthcare, neurosurgery, neuroscience, and even the arts.

The book was created by Helen Borel, RN,MFA,PhD

Hi, I'm Aaliyah. With an extensive background in babysitting for children of all ages--coupled with my college coursework in early education and my fun-loving and caring personality--I am confident that I can provide excellent childcare to your family.
As a freshman at Nassau Community College, I am pursuing a degree in Early Childhood Education due to my love of working with children. For the past four years, I have served as a babysitter to the same family, for which I am happy to provide a reference. This family included children from infancy through age 11. From preparing healthy snacks and changing diapers to playing at the park and building forts, I am enthusiastic and supportive in every aspect of caring for children. Additionally, I have experience helping young children through separation anxiety situations, using distraction and refocusing techniques to help kids through those tough emotions.
My previous experience also includes an ongoing summer camp counselor position at the local YMCA for four consecutive summers, providing support and guidance to elementary-aged children in the areas of sports, swimming, nature walks, cooking, and social group interactions.
I do not drive; however, I will always be on time and enthusiastic to start my working day. I am fun, loving, caring and very social. 
My babysitting skills and experience, along with my positive attitude and friendly nature, position me to excel in this role. I would love the opportunity to meet your family and discuss my qualifications in more detail.

Good Day,

How are you? I am hoping to find a long term live-in nanny position with a wonderful family. Offering 15+ years experience and proficiency in assimilating into a new family culture. Skilled in creating schedules, following commitments and maintaining routines. Bringing a compassionate childcare approach and exceptional child development skills to contribute to the family. My years of experience and training have fostered my ability to develop close relationships with both children and families. I have excellent communication skills, relate well to people and converse in a polite and courteous manner. I have a can do attitude and take great pride in everything I do. 

My experience has been working with families in New York City, Southampton, Long Island and Massachusetts. My last live-in nanny position was in Framingham, MA. I stayed with the family for eight wonderful years. Caring for a very sweet boy who was three years old when I arrived. At this present time he is starting his second year of college. I'm so proud of him!

I have found my nanny profession to be a very rewarding experience. I love to watch children learn and grow, while teaching them kindness, sharing, compassion and love. Always learning from children I'm working with everyday. I admire children's endless energy, honesty, creativity, flexibility and resilience. Knowing that my job is to help children achieve their full potential and help them feel good about themselves, brings a huge smile to my face.

I am a well mannered, articulate and responsible nanny with a great deal of experience and interest in children and their development. A confident child carer who is loving and devoted to her job.
Working with children is my true passion. When you are doing something you love, you truly shine. I always go above and beyond in my job. I hope to build a strong relationship and trust with my next family. With a strong foundation and open communication, the children can have an exceptional nanny as they grow and mature.

Some of my core competencies are being reliable, patient, trustworthy, organized and creative. A wonderful cook who has a passion for preparing and cooking healthy food. Also very, flexible with my time. I will be happy to help with light housekeeping and errands need be. I do have my own car with a great driving history.
I can provide you with references upon request and answer any questions you may have. Thank you very much for your time!

All the best to you and your family!

499,"***Hire our INCREDIBLE NANNY - Full or Part Time, Live-In***",https://newyork.craigslist.org/fct/kid/d/hire-our-incredible-nanny/6297391185.html,"Wilton, CT","
        
Our incredible Filipina nanny, who has been with us for over 17 years, is looking for a new full or part-time live-in nanny position in the Fairfield County area.   She is truly amazing - no words can really do her justice.  Since both my husband and I work, we were really in need of help, and throughout the years, Maria Theresa has been everything we could have asked for.   She is the kind of nanny that would braid our daughters' hair everyday before school, wake up early to cook special breakfasts on our children's birthdays, and hand-make ornaments for the Christmas tree each year.  Over the years, she has truly become part of our family and a loving ""aunt"" to our three children.  Now that our kids are grown up (our two eldest are off to college, youngest in high school), though, we have realized we unfortunately no longer need a full-time nanny at home.  Therefore, we are trying to find her a part or full time nannying position with another family in the Fairfield County area.  

Maria Theresa is one of the most loving, patient, and genuinely caring people we have ever known.  She is college educated and an excellent cook.  We cannot recommend her more highly.  

She is looking for a position in Fairfield County or Manhattan areas with mainly childcare duties (light housekeeping and cooking are ok, but she would like the focus of her job to be taking care of the children).    Of note, she does NOT drive.  

Please call Maria Theresa directly on her cell phone at 
 
.  If you would like to speak with us (the family), please send us an email using the Craigslist email address.  We would be more than happy to answer any questions you might have, either via email or on the phone.  Thank you!

527,EXPECTING A BABY & SEEKING AFFORDABLE CHILD CARE IN MURRAY HILL?,https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/kid/d/expecting-baby-seeking/6292882974.html,Murray Hill,"
        
We are expectant professional parents, baby due in late January, seeking to meet similarly situated expectant parents to plan for a nanny share. 

We are posting this now because we are learning how difficult and expensive trustworthy childcare is to secure. Because we both work long hours, it appears that most group childcare will be impractical for us. (Most childcare facilities close at 6pm or so.) The cost of a private nanny seems prohibitive and, perhaps, even undesirable. So we are seeking to meet other expectant parents who are in a similar situation and, perhaps, agree to share a nanny in the neighborhood. 

We live at 40th street and Second Avenue and looking to meet another family -very- close by to us: We are thinking of an area bounded north by 44rd Street and south by 37th Street, and from First Avenue to Third Avenue. We hope to meet a happy, thoughtful, professional married couple for this purpose.

Please write to us if this seems an arrangement you may be interested in. Please also feel free to share any information or advice on this subject that you may have. We would very much appreciate it.

Hello hello,

I am Nicole, sunflower by day analytical artist by night.

With 3 Nieces and 3 Nephews, aged 12, 8, 4, 3,3, and 8 months I have managed to rack up a good amount of care taking experience as well as the patience of a saint :) and since you can't choose your family, it teaches you to love and care unconditionally - love that as extended to few other family and friends whose children I've had the opportunity to care for whilst back home in South Africa.

I would love to be able to do the same while here in America while I get to explore and get to experience my first white Christmas.

What I have to offer :

Hugs (a lot of them), as well as care, structure, discipline and a great environment to learn and grow. I understand that all children have different personalities and I endeavor to treat them accordingly.

I am constantly amazed at children's ability to absorb information so easily at a young age and thus always use every activity as an opportunity to teach. I believe that my background as a graphic designer combined with my love for education has allowed for me to be able to use lateral thinking and creativity as an advantage in advancing little humans, not only in developing their minds but developing their personalities too.

If you are interested in hiring me please do not hesitate to contact me at any time, I am available as live in / live out at $20 an hour

HOLA! :) HELLO! :)
Welcome to our post about Little Steps Day Care!

A little about us:

A small look at our philosophy:

-We are aware of the importance of cleanliness and the major role it plays in our children's health. We make it a priority to provide an atmosphere that promotes health, prevents illnesses and teaches children healthy and safe practices towards wellness from a young age. 
-We create weekly plans utilizing observational data to support goals for both individual and group children. Schedules include a balance of learning experiences and activities that provide opportunities for children to interact with one another and the outside world, develop their senses and stimulate their mental and physical growth.
-We believe in developing a warm, positive, supportive and responsive relationship with each child. Getting to know who they are not only aides in providing the best care, but it helps us assist each child in learning about their individuality and cultural identities allowing a sense of pride in them to flourish. 
-We believe in a program that incorporates the essence of togetherness within providers and families. One that encourages the cooperation of the children's families and provides them different means of communication and resources.

Our daycare aims to provide top quality in-home child care services and a welcoming atmosphere for both children and families. 
We'd love to hear from you! Give us a call or send us an e-mail for more information and to set up a tour.

Hi my name is JACCELYN  I am a mother of two my husband the father of our two children was deported in 2012.  I work Monday through Friday as a nanny full time I recently moved my kids out of a bad neighborhood into a better environment it cost me a ton of money to move but my determination would not allow me to waiver. My sister whom is 7 months pregnant was homeless living in another state so I got her a bus ticket here recently and moved her to live with us. She came with only one bag so now I am taking care of three soon I'll be taken care of four. I work for everything I have and now have come up short on my late fee as it pertains to my rent my landlord is saying if I don't have my late fee by September 15th 2017 that he will have to start legal actions I have begged him to allow me to pay the late fee next month but he said he don't have any choice that this is the way it works.... which is 10% of the rent and that's $129 I can afford my rent but have just fallen way behind getting my kids situated in our new home and getting all that my pregnant sister needs. We currently have no money and I'm working my behind off, my next pay date is September 22nd so I can pay back anyone who was able to help me as a loan or work payments off in the evenings or weekends. If anyone can help me please get in touch with me as soon as possible My mom can confirm my situations and I also have an email from my landlord.

Hello, Welcome to Sunshine Daycare. My name is Vanessa Liang. I provide a family daycare that is exceptionally convenient, safe, fun for children of all ages. We have teachers and students in different ethnicities and they learn very well to cooperate with each other.  The teachers teach with pride and patience for the children to learn mannerism and develop social skills. I believe this will assist them to get a jump start in early life. We provide the children with daily healthy food, fun activities and learning environment in the classroom. We also do offer pickup service.  Our rates are very affordable and the best in the area. I have many references from our customers from providing outstanding service. Please feel free to contact me if you should have any questions. I look forward to speaking with you all.

My daycare hours are Mon-Fri 8am-6pm, with some flexibility if needed.
Our daily activities include: story time, arts and crafts, circle time, exercising, music and dance, outdoor fun in a nearby play area. We have weekly learning themes which include: science experiments, letters, numbers, shapes, colors, seasons, holidays, fire safety, friendship, and so much more.

I provide breakfast and lunch which are prepared daily, as well as afternoon snack. We are located in College Point, very close to Flushing.

We pick up after school from PS 29 and PS 129

We learn, play and have lots of fun!
Thank you,
Sunshine Daycare

Exceptional Nanny/babysitter available for part-time childcare


Recently my nanny has gone to a part time schedule
given my littlest daughter entered kindergarten.  She is looking to supplement working with our
family with other babysitting job(s). Her availability is M-F, 7:00 am-1:00 pm. 
Ideally she would like something regular, 2-5 days per week, but ad hoc is not out of the question.  Additionally, she is available for errands, organizing, and other tasks to ease your day to day. 

A little note about our Nanny. She has worked with us for 8 years.  My three daughters, ages 10, 9, and 5, adore her and are extremely attached.   She is kind, caring, responsible, fun, yet appropriately
stern when needed.  Childcare is not a part time gig for her.  Prior to working
with our family, she worked for another family and a day care for a few years.  We trust her explicitly with our children, 2 dogs, vehicle, personal documents, etc.  I think the world of our Nanny and have NO hesitation referring her.

QUEENS CENTER OF THE ARTS
at Innovations In Creative Arts offers an amazing After School Time Program.

From One day, to three days, five days, or all six days per week, children have the opportunity to learn through real creative activities with historical content.  How many talents, inventors, brilliant people should they know about, be inspired by, relate to?  People who look just like them and perhaps walked the same streets as they do now?

Not just babysitting, your child can choose between two major creative, martial arts, literary, science, cooking, performance arts, etc. activities each day and have the time to fully explore and engage in the learning process.  Learning takes time, putting it all together and seeing the connection between things also takes time. At Queens Center of the Arts, that's what we're all about - Real Kids, Real Activities, Real Artists and Certified Professionals teaching, mentoring, and encouraging. 

Registration is now open for September.  Visit the website or stop in and visit. Come see what we're all about and what makes our program unique and valuable.  

Summer Hours: Tuesdays - Fridays 2:00pm - 7:30pm; Saturdays 10:00 - 7:30pm
September - June:  Mondays - Fridays 2:00pm - 8:00pm; Saturdays 9:30am - 8:00pm

When's the last time you were able to read a book without a ""to-do"" list on your conscience?

I'm an accomplished PA hoping to serve a family that needs part-time assistance.  I'm currently listed with a top NYC staffing agency and have ten years of experience offering long-term service.  My references are stellar - nab me on Craig's List and save yourself the 15% gross salary fee! 

I'm warm, pleasant and pride myself on making my families happy.  If you know you could use a hand, but balk at the notion of bringing someone on board who'll require an orientation and will be privy to the specifics of your chaos - I'm your girl.  I'm a quick study and will work quickly towards a system that allows me to anticipate need.

I provide both on-site and virtual assistance - clients usually need a mix of both.  You'd have the freedom to offload tasks and requests 24/7 as they enter your head space and be assured that you're delegating to someone who will follow-through.  I'm sharing the standard list of tasks that I provide - it becomes more family-specific over time:
     
     Schedule and oversee home repairs
     Schedule and oversee home maintenance
     Purchase household equipment, supplies and services
     Purchase groceries
     Create and maintain organizational systems
     Liaise with household suppliers, vendors, colleagues, clients
     Manage personal calendar
     Manage personal correspondence (daily, holiday)
     Hire/ supervise/ support/ terminate staff (nannies, housekeepers, groundskeepers, tutors)
     Manage designated projects
     Manage personal appointments
     Arrange travel plans/ itineraries/ accommodations
     Arrange dinner reservations
     Assist with event/ party planning
     Assist with personal shopping (errands, gifts, holidays)
     Prepare and oversee mailings
     Assist with bill payment
     Assist with online sale of household items
     Perform internet research

Let me know how I can help you find time in your day - I'll get you sorted!    ",c

Our wonderful, loving nanny is unable to join us in our move to Westchester and will be available starting early September.  Patrenda is an amazing nanny in so many ways - we credit her for our daughter's very early speech and expansive vocabulary (Patrenda never stopped talking and singing to her); she always has such helpful suggestions about how to solve problems, and offers them kindly and generously (from sleeping to eating to diaper rashes); and she loves our daughter as her own (and our daughter loves her just like another parent).  After interviewing over a dozen candidates, we knew she was the right one for us.  We are truly sorry that she can't continue to be a part of our family, but we know she'll quickly become an asset to another family here.  Feel free to call/text me (Kathleen

We are posting this now because are learning how expensive trustworthy childcare is to secure. Because we both work long hours, it appears that most group childcare will be impractical for us. (Most childcare facilities close at 6pm or so.) The cost of a private nanny seems prohibitive and, perhaps, even undesirable. So we are seeking to meet other expectant parents who are in a similar situation and, perhaps, agree to share a nanny in the neighborhood. 

We live at 40th street and Second Avenue and looking to meet another family -very- close by to us: We are thinking of an area bounded north by 43rd Street and south by 38th Street, and from First Avenue to Third Avenue. We hope to meet a happy, thoughtful, professional married couple for this purpose.

Please write to us if this seems an arrangement you may be interested in. Please also feel free to share any information or advice on this subject that you may have. We would very much appreciate it.

Hello!

I am a high school English teacher who is interested in tutoring weekday evenings.

I have taught all levels of high school English for over 20 years, but also have some middle-school English experience. I have taught college classes as an adjunct, as well.

I am able to assist students with writing, reading comprehension, and/or vocabulary skills; I am also equipped to prepare a teenager for the ACT/SAT verbal sections or the ACT/SAT English test. 

I take tutoring as seriously as I take my full-time teaching job and always show up fully prepared.  

My rate is $65/hr. Upon request, I can provide my resume and/or references from my department chair and principal. 

Please let me know if you would like to arrange a meeting.

I love sports, board games, writing, art -- I bond with children over tons of subjects and activities while ensuring the atmosphere is safe and that your child is cared for. 

I have experience in preparing meals, putting children to bed, including baths, teeth-brushing and telling stories, as well as helping with homework, chaperoning playdates, escorting to and from school, watching for multiple days and nights in a row, and so on. I also have a wide set of organization skills, and have arranged and kept track of appointments and meetings for both parents and children.

I can tutor French, English, math, science, and have no allergies to any animals and am available as well for pet-sitting or dog-walking.

Give your child the very best by enrolling him in Gold Material Montessori School + Child Day Care Center. At our preschool we firmly believe parents should shop for daycare as much as they shop for a good doctor. As parents we want a service that is of high quality and convenience.

In the simplest terms, Gold Materiam Montessori School provides educational child care. But our commitment to kids doesn't stop there. We are passionate about providing your children with the tools they need to be successful in all aspects of their lives.

A Stimulating Environment
Unlike traditional day care, a Montessori School education combines our strong preschool curriculum and a safe, stimulating environment to create meaningful experiences for your child every day.

Our Whole Child Educational Approach
By focusing on nurturing seven skill areas (including early literacy, logical thinking, problem solving, social understanding, physical coordination, creativity and positive character traits, such as cooperation and self-control) - an approach that we call our whole child education - we help your child develop the critical-thinking skills and intellectual curiosity that fuel success in his or her kindergarten classroom and beyond.

Active Learning through Highly Trained Teachers
Our dedicated and highly trained teachers focus on more than just reading, writing and arithmetic by also creating active learning experiences around character building, physical activity and social and emotional development.

Please visit our website at  to get more information about the programs and to schedule a visit to our school.    ",a

Seasoned guitarist, bassist and multi-instrumentalist. Teaching Guitar, bass, uke, vocals, mandolin, piano, theory, songwriting, pro tools, logic, cubase, ableton live, etc....with 20 + years of experience recently moved to CT from NYC. 
Played with people like Tito Puente Jr., Lucie Arnaz and Bette Midler.

Teaching all styles including Jazz, rock, blues, reggae, pop, folk, bluegrass, classical etc......finger style, picking, slap, etc....

Years in public and private schools. 
Songwriter, audio engineer and performance credits from major venues in LA, NYC, CT and many more. Toured in multiple bands and have been teaching since I was 18. I am 34 years old, respectful and professional and very good at what I do:)
In home lessons (I come to you)
$50 per hour lesson or
$80 for a two hour lesson


My guitar teachers had various styles, but the best ones actually asked me what ""I Wanted"" to learn and found ways to teach me, but also added a healthy dose of hard theory based practice that ""I didn't know I needed"". 

The worst ones simply gave me exercises to do and hurried me out of the room to get a paycheck. 

I truly care about sharing my knowledge and making my students better and creating an environment where they can explore their strengths and weaknesses. 

I love to teach and am very good at it. Feel free to ask me any questions you have and check out my playing here.

I was working (better to say I was in love with) for the family nearly 7 years (children of different ages, from the baby till 15 years old).
We were busy with interesting activities, 
developing imagination, taste, designing, drawing, playing ball, listening to fairy tales, 
eating a healhy and tasty meal, (children liked my cooking) so we became true friends and we are keeping in touch. 
I have excellent recommendations from this family. 

I am an architect, but for numerous years have been working with children of different ages and it has been wonderful! 
I have also studied children psychology for two years that has helped me too.
I have experience to work with sweet babies (New born-1 year) too, I own techniques of early development

If You don't have time with household chores, I can help You with it. 

I am loving, compassionate, polite, punctual. I love being part of children's lives and to create loving cheerful atmosphere. 
I can continue, but probably opinion of other people, who know me, is more important, so i will provide recommendations for your reference. 

Priority location would be Manhattan and areas, but it can be another place too, I'm flexible. 
My salary depends on a situation.it's flexible. 
I am available to discuss your expectations in an interview at your convenience. 
Looking forward to hearing from You soon.

Amazing Forest Hills family seeking an experienced nanny for their 2-year-old in Forest Hills, Queens. 

The ideal candidate is a confident and kind caregiver who creates a fun, safe and caring environment for child while setting clear boundaries for her. This is the right job for you if you enjoy being active, outdoors, reading and playing. As working parents, we  request your help with basic housekeeping (making beds each morning, loading/emptying of dishwasher, laundry, tidying up toys and kitchen after meals by sweeping floor and wiping counters). Responsibilities include attending daily scheduled activities, overseeing playtime, occasional meal prep and running of errands. Fluent Spanish speaker preferred. Toddler will attend play school from 12-2:45pm, so family expect the caregiver to use this time to assistwith househould tasks and errands.    ",b

If you've been searching for a nanny or babysitter here and you're hoping to find someone more educated, more experienced, and maybe a little more savvy than the status quo, then I'm your guy.

First, some highlights:
-- Highest honors in dual bachelor's degrees from a top-five art school. [education & sculpture]
-- Ivy League graduate study in education.
-- Graduate of well-known boarding preparatory high school. Served as prefect for two years.
-- Former nanny for two boys from a high-profile family in the financial district.
-- Former teacher in both private and public school settings, largely in gifted education.
-- Completely fluent in spoken and written French.

As for the Renaissance element: I play several instruments, I'm involved in the visual arts, and I used to be on an MTV program. All of these have made me a good fit for kids who think they're ""too cool"" for a nanny, by the way.

In addition, I practice a martial art, I'm active in athletics, and I'm a firm believer in spending time with children outdoors (just like Rousseau). I've published several papers on child development in peer-reviewed journals. I'm a natural autodidact and truly enjoy sharing my love of learning with my charges.

I have experience with both full- and part-time arrangements, and I'm open to either. I work well with all children, including tweens/teenagers, children with learning and behavioral differences, and introverted or otherwise unique kids. Being a male nanny is much more than a job for me--it's a testament to my deep interest in education and child development.

All of the above is detailed in my résumé, and I come with fantastic references, so send me an email and let's discuss the particulars of your situation!

I'm very much looking forward to hearing from you.

Sitters Studio, New York's premier babysitting agency, is looking for new team members to join us. Sitters Studio is unlike a traditional agency because we staff artists (singers, actors, painters, dancers etc.) as babysitters. We believe babysitting should not only be safe but also artistically fun.

Sitters Studio is a great community for artists because we provide flexible schedules, access to gym memberships, as well as a group of fellow artists to keep you motivated and connected to your art. 

We are looking for sitters to join our community for PART TIME work. We are particularly interested in meeting sitters who have newborn/infant experience and available to work weekends. You will need at least 3 references, with a minimum of 2 being childcare references. We have wonderful families looking for regular sitters and offer opportunities to sit for some families in the top hotels in the city.

We are expectant professional parents Due in late January, seeking to meet similarly situated expectant parents to plan fora Nanny Share. 

We are posting this now because are learning how expensive trustworthy childcare is to secure. Because we both work long hours, it appears that most group childcare will be impractical for us. (Most childcare facilities close at 6pm or so.) The cost of a private nanny seems prohibitive and, perhaps, even undesirable. So we are seeking to meet other expectant parents who are in a similar situation and, perhaps, agree to share a nanny in the neighborhood. 

We live at 40th street and Second Avenue and looking to meet another family -very- close by to us: We are thinking of an area bounded north by 44rd Street and south by 37th Street, and from First Avenue to Third Avenue. We hope to meet a happy, thoughtful, professional married couple for this purpose.

Please write to us if this seems an arrangement you may be interested in. Please also feel free to share any information or advice on this subject that you may have. We would very much appreciate it.

Hi! I started babysitting at 12 and became a teacher and guidance counselor.  I had a special education job last year at a private school but it was challenging as some of the students would scratch and kick and a few teachers got concussions from the autistic kids. I would like to work as a nanny this year. I love to sing, dance, and play sports so I am still a kid at heart but over 35 lol. Please don't contact me if you want me to check out your service or website. I need to speak on the phone to see if this is a real reply. Rate and duties negotiable. I am a very flexible and easy going person who loves kids.  Please let me know the town and ages of your kids and hours needed.

Bus pick-up is at 3:50 PM near our home by the Bed-Stuy YMCA. I return home from work between 6:00 and 6:30 PM. 
I'd like the caregiver to help with homework, prepare snacks, go on trips to local parks, do creative play (arts, crafts), or reading with my second-grader.

My wife and I have a 4 month old baby girl. I work full time and she is about to go back to work on a part time basis. I would like to see if there is a better option out there besides daycare which is the reason for this ad. We would need a nanny on Mondays and Wednesday to come to our apartment (large apartment complex with doorman, parking garage, children' room, pool, gym etc). The hours would be 8:30 until 5:30 or 6pm. We are looking for someone with all the right certifications and good references.

Here is the twist (and I know this won't be for everyone so please don't respond if your not serious). My wife and I have a don't ask don't tell open relationship, I can have my fun and she can have hers as long as neither has to hear about it (I know that lifestyle isn't for everyone but it works for us). I work from home a decent amount (I am in sales) and wanted to put out a feeler to see if there is someone that meets our requirements as a nanny and would also potentially be open to playing with me (if there is comfort and mutual attraction). It also doesn't have to be sex, and can be something we develop over time. This is not a requirement and obviously the childcare requirements are the most important and comes first over all else. I just want to see if there is someone out there open to the idea should we want to move forward with having a nanny.

We are a young 30 year old couple, I am in finance and also play a semi professional sport. 

I want to find out what the going rate might be for the 2 days we would need you to watch our little one and see if it makes better sense then dropping her off at a daycare. 

If you fit the description above, please respond with a little about you, your certifications, and confirm your openness to the ""twist"". Please also let me know your going rate for your services so I can better compare and determine if it's a better option for me.

If you want to include a picture of yourself then even better. Again I know this opportunity is not going to be everyone's cup of tea so if you don't fit the bill then please refrain from responding.

Going to the skatepark, jamming with your child on a new song we're learning, and taking him/her and their friends to all-ages afternoon shows are my kind of activities. Of course, this comes alongside the traditional stuff: I can help in all school subjects, I speak three languages, and I know my way around the city, the online world, and the library equally well. Love museums and galleries. Great at handling drama and ""kid crises."" Good with smart kids, unusual kids, and cool kids (all the same thing, as far as I'm concerned).

My nanny of 12+ years is seeking a new family starting in the fall in Brooklyn or Manhattan. Nelesia is a warm and awesome nanny, who came to me when my daughter was 4 months old. Nelesia from day one has been a valuable partner in helping raise my daughter into a warm, loving, and respectful young lady. She was a most helpful in helping my daughter adjust during my divorce a few years ago.

Nelesia's Skills

As my daughter's nanny, Nelesia has proven to be versed in the developmental stages of infants and toddlers, while maintaining a high level of professionalism. She has performed the duties of managing all aspects of my daughter's daily routine, which includes, but to not limited to planning and preparing nutritious meals, taking her to appointments and planning indoor and outdoor activities for my daughter that were fun, educational and fit my daughter's needs. 

While we will miss Nelesia very much, I am confident that she will be an asset to your family.

To get contact information for Nelesia or for a reference, reply to this post.    ",

Hi,

We are a professional couple with a ten month old baby located in Mamaroneck, Westchester and are seeking a full-time nanny. We are wondering if there are any other families who may need part or full-time care (can be flexible) and are interested in a nanny share, to help alleviate costs and provide the children with companionship.

I will be happy to host in my home, as I mainly work from home and can provide an additional level of supervision.

We have not yet found a nanny, so we can potentially search for one together as well.

Please note, this ad is only for other parents seeking a nanny share situation.    ",

Hello. I am a college senior available for babysitting. I have over 7 years of experience babysitting infants to school aged children both for my family members and outside clients. In addition, I have four years experience working as a tutor for children privately as well as in school preparation programs, so I'll make sure your children enjoy doing their homework and learning!

I have taken a semester-long course in First Aid and Safety and have been certified in Basic Life Support which includes pediatric CPR since 2013. I maintain a 3.7 GPA and am soon graduating with a Bachelor's in Chemistry with the intention to apply to medical school. 

I'm willing to assist with cleaning, shopping, laundry, and food preparation while caring for your kids. I am a licensed driver and own a car, so I am more than willing to bring your kids out to the park or playground or other activities to keep them active. I absolutely love all the time that I get to spend around children and am excited to meet some new faces!

Please email me if you are interested in my professional profile or references.    ",

Hello,

I am 26yrs old and a stay at home mom for my 2 little girls, a 20 month old and a 6 month old .  I have cared for children of all ages for over 10yrs and truly enjoy it.  I am seeking a child care position in my home because I love being home with my girls but my husband and I are in need of a second income.

A normal day for my girls and I would be having breakfast, lunch and dinner with 2 snacks inbetween.  I mostly purchase organic and snacks usually consist of fruit.  We love to play, dance around the house, read books and take walks when the weather is nice.  We do not have any pets and live in a one level home.

If you have any questions please email me and I will get back to you as soon as possible.    ",

1882,Responsible and Educated Manny / Male Babysitter  (Columbia intern),https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/kid/d/responsible-and-educated/6305557744.html,Union Square,"
        
Hello,

I am a college graduate currently working part-time here in the city as a mentor / manny (like an older brother) for an awesome Manhattan family. I'm looking to get more hours so am posting here in the hopes of meeting someone who needs family assistance.

I grew up helping in the classroom - my mom is a teacher - a while a senior in high school I was a tutor at the elementary school across the street. My aunts and uncles have also hired me to tutor and help with my cousins (e.g., school work, play dates, errands, etc.).

Below is a summary of my academic and professional qualifications (education, skills, and talents) as well as more information on my experiences.

-Bachelor's degree in the social sciences from top 35 university in the US
-Speak three languages: native English, fluent Portuguese, conversational Spanish
-Study abroad experience (full year in developing nation)
-Internship at Columbia University

As a manny, I've done light homework help; preparing snacks and basic meals/ordering dinners for the kids and I; helping clean up of messes; reading and educational activities; and fun games and related activities the kids enjoy--Legos, Star Wars, dinosaurs, imaginary games, board games, art and drawing/sketching, to name a few. I strive to create a stable, healthy, and fun environment for the kids and to set a good example and be an inspirational role model. I am a non-smoker, pet-friendly, and am flexible in scheduling.

Please reach out if you would like to know more, and tell me about yourself and what your needs are. The arrangement I am seeking would be a guaranteed 20 hours per week, preferably Monday to Friday sometime around 3 pm to 7 pm give or take. I would be available to help on school holidays and possibly a weekend here or there as long as we scheduled with advanced notice. The age range I am qualified to help with is first graders to teenage years, and I would be most comfortable with one to two kids. Because I live in Manhattan, I do not drive and so would be unable to function as a driver. My longer term goals are to attend grad school, but since that takes one to two years from applying, I'd be able to commit for one to two years.

Lastly, what I am looking for in a family is what I offer as an assistant: trust, respect, generosity, and thoughtfulness. 

Thank you.    ",

Lituania's Bio

Hello Parents. I'm a very loving, honest and responsible woman. Why I love to be a nanny? There's nothing in this world more fun than children. I love to teach them so many things and you don't imagine all the things we do on the table doing arts & crafts or when the girls want to do a dress up show or when they start saying their first words in Spanish. They truly fulfill my heart. When you do what you love, it's not a job, it's a blessing.

Jasmin's Bio

Hello! My name is Jasmin. I'm a very artistic and creative person. I am 20 years old and I am a nursing student at New York City College of Technology. I have worked in a daycare as a summer job before, working with children 6 years old playing with them, giving them snacks, taking them to trips to the park and library. I also occasionally babysat my cousins, which is where I gained most of my experience. For one of my cousins I watched over 3 of her children since I was in the 8th grade (ages are 15, 8, and 5 now). My other cousin I babysat her daughter at my house for really late nights, she is 8 years old now, but I watched her when she was a toddler (1-2 years old). I have also volunteered in a school being a teacher's assistant for a kindergarten class grading, testing, and helping the students out with class work, reading, writing, math. I have experience working with other families.    ",

We are an experienced entertainment company with over 20 years of experience serving Suffolk and Nassau Counties looking to add more wonderful people to our staff. We have a great opportunity for you to make money and have fun doing it. You must enjoy working with children, be energetic and be ready to have fun. If this interests you, please read everything below and then apply! We are looking for full year staff. Our company really makes sure we take care of our staff.

We are a full service entertainment company with fifteen years of experience and owned by two teachers. We are based in the Smithtown area in Suffolk County NY.


This is a really fun job working with children. It is also great experience to put on a teaching resume. It helped my wife and I to both get our teaching positions. We are willing to pay a good price and we have an excellent reputation in the entertainment industry. We are extremely fair people who are great to work with and for. We currently have a great staff of people but we are adding more parties so we need to increase our staff. This is a great job to supplement your income. It is usually one to two days a week so it is a part-time position, but has great potential.

Right now, the warm weather is here it is extremely busy and it will be busy and there will also be additional weekday opportunities if you are interested.

Pay is $30 per hour event plus tips, $45 for 1 ½ hr. events plus tips and $60 for a 2 hr. event plus tips.

Types of events that you would like to work

Do you feel you could be a princess character?

We are a family based daycare. Dedicating each and everyday to nourish young children's minds and hearts with love, as if they've never left home. 

Because we are family based, children here come in to their second home. They nap on beds not cots, they have breakfast, lunch and dinner at the kitchen table with all their friends, they learn to be kind to each other, to say please and thank you, to play together as friends and most importantly to be confident! Here we not only care for your children, but we try to teach them things that you as a parent would want to nourish upon your children. We understand that its hard enough going to work and having to leave them behind, so we offer services like text updates and picture updates. So that you can feel calm knowing that your children are doing wonderfully. 

Our daily routines include and are not limited to.. breakfast, story time, play time, potty time, lunch, nap time, sing song time, art time, ABC's and 123's and lots of hugs in between. 


Our days begin at 6am and end at 8pm. (EXTRA HOURS ARE AVAILABLE) We also offer weekend and Overnight. (at an extra rate). Our children's ages range from 12 months - 5 yrs old. 



I am CPR certified, DayCare provider certified and Assistant Teacher certification for Pre-K and Kindergarten.

Summers over and schools are back in session. Are you struggling to find a baby sitter and/or after school programs? Enroll your child in A.S.F (After School Fun). Staff picks up your child from school and escorts them to the afterschool activities we have planned for the evening. Pick up is usually 2:30/3pm depending on the schools and after school activities end 7pm. We also do drop off's at your home address (additional fee) or you can pick up your child at our locations. Some of our activities are indoor swiming, dance class, basketball tournaments, out door movie nights (weather permitting), rooftop portrait painting, ice skating (winter) and more. This is a great oppurtunity for your child to stay productive after school while socializing with his/her peers. You can request an application for A.S.F by emailing:

Lituania's Bio

Hello Parents. I'm a very loving, honest and responsible woman. Why I love to be a nanny? There's nothing in this world more fun than children. I love to teach them so many things and you don't imagine all the things we do on the table doing arts & crafts or when the girls want to do a dress up show or when they start saying their first words in Spanish. They truly fulfill my heart. When you do what you love, it's not a job, it's a blessing.

Jasmin's Bio

Hello! My name is Jasmin. I am a very artistic and creative person. I am 20 years old and I'm a nursing student at New York City College of Technology. I have worked in a daycare as a summer job before, working with children 6 years old playing with them, giving them snacks, taking them to trips to the park and library. I also occasionally babysat my cousins, which is where I gained most of my experience. For one of my cousins I watched over 3 of her children since I was in the 8th grade (ages are 15, 8, and 5 now). My other cousin I babysat her daughter at my house for really late nights, she is 8 years old now, but I watched her when she was a toddler (1-2 years old). I have also volunteered in a school being a teacher's assistant for a kindergarten class grading, testing, and helping the students out with class work, reading, writing, math. I have experience working with other families.    ",

Hello,
I am looking for someone who can care for and help my competent and happy 6 and 10 year olds get to school in the morning. I would need someone to arrive at 5:30 am and they would be done as soon as the children were dropped at school between 8 and 8:30 am. The school is just a few blocks from our home so no transportation is necessary, just walking. I need someone Monday through Friday. The 6 year old may need some help getting dressed and they will both need breakfast. I am looking for someone who is happy, prompt, responsible and enjoys the company of young children. I will need references as well but do not need a professional nanny. I would be happy to help out college students with babysitting experience also. Please let me know if this arrangement interests you and send along salary requirements with your response. I look forward to hearing from you!

I have been a NYC nanny for over 11 years with experience with newborn to teenagers. My goal and objective is to provide a fun well organized nurturing day for any child in my care. I keep schedules and form balanced routines for feeding napping and play. 
My typical duties include but not limited to:
Feeding and diapering, preparing meals, laundry, potty training, tidying up, taking kids to playdates and classes, running errands and light housekeeping. 
I am a very happy, fun caring and active woman with a bubbly personality. Spending time outside is very important to me as it helps kids develop a sense of nature and awareness. I love to read and encourage reading with kids, I read to them and sing, play crafts and games puzzles and board games.
Being a nanny is very rewarding to me as I love being a part of childrens upbringing helping instill core values they can learn from. By hiring me as your nanny, you will be very happy and feel secure that your children are in the care of a woman who genuinely loves them.

My name is Alisha and I'm looking for a short term or occasional position as a night nanny.

I have experience with the Montessori method and specialize in infant and toddler care.

For the past 2.5 years, I have been a live-in nanny for a family with an almost 3 year old boy who is on the autism spectrum. I assisted them temporarily with postpartum care at 7 weeks and they offered me my position from there. Because he's getting older and his care needs are changing, I find myself looking to help like I was able to do with them. Pregnancy can be tough on everyone and through my experiences, I've created a toolbox of information that can help others. I don't have all the answers, but I certainly like to try. Of note, I have experience with postpartum depression and anxiety, as well as understanding and compassion for almost any situation. Many people go through it, but you don't have to do it alone.

You can rely on me for loving and attentive full night care of your child, including diapering, feeding, putting to sleep/soothing, reading to, and if needed, administering medications such as breathing treatments or topical ointments (no syringe medication). I'm a night owl who often isn't tired until 3 or 4 anyway. I prefer to be able to rest in the room if the baby is sleeping anytime between 2a and 7a (if I doze, I'm a very light sleeper), but am willing to be awake. 

I'm also available to help with any pre-birth preparations, especially for those on bed rest, either short or long term. This includes running errands, assembling baby furniture, offering suggestions on supplies, accompanying on appointments, and even laundry, light cleaning, bathing/clothing assistance, and overall company and/or support.

I'm CPR and First Aid certified (including infant) since 1998. I also have my associates and have had multiple child development and care trainings over the course of my career. 

I'm available 5p-9a, but I am willing to discuss some fluctuation in hours. I'm available up to 3 days a week and there is a 4 hour minimum. If leaving between midnight and 6a, I would require a car home. My usual babysitting rate is $20/hr for one child and with this being an on-demand, evening/overnight position, my rate would be a bit more, which I'm willing to discuss. I don't want to break the bank for folks and I enjoy helping, but I also have to make it worth the schedule flipping it can entail, such as last minute needs.

I have references and am willing to meet during the week in the afternoon or evening for interviews. Thank you for taking the time to read this and please don't hesitate to email me with any questions.    ",

Hello! 

My name is Sara. I have over ten years of experience working with children. I am 23 years old, and am very fun-loving and energetic. I've taken care of all ages, infants to teenagers, my most experience with toddlers & primary schoolers. I love spending time with kids and helping parents add peace and sanity to their everyday life. I love games, art & crafts, sports --- I bond with children over many subjects and activities while ensuring the atmosphere is safe and that your child is cared for. 

I have experience in preparing meals, bedtime, baths, teeth-brushing, telling stories, helping with homework, chaperoning playdates, escorting to and from school, watching for multiple days and nights in a row, and so on. I also have a wide set of organization skills, and have arranged and kept track of appointments and meetings for both parents and children.  

My first language is English, my second language is French, and I have an ESL-Teaching certificate. I can tutor French, English, and math, and have no allergies to any animals and am available as well for pet-sitting or dog-walking. I love animals! I also have experience as a Mother's Helper for when you just need that extra help with the kids. 

In addition, I have a BA from Hunter College. 

I live in Queens, and I am willing to travel to Manhattan and Brooklyn. I'm looking for about 25 hours a week, somebody needing an escort to afterschool activies, homework help and the occasional nighttime sitter. I'm a writer in my free time so I have a flexible schedule.

. I have a resume and references available upon request and I am happy to answer any questions you may have.

Hello, I am a 30 year old woman from Queens very close to Manhattan and close to the 7 train. I have years of experience with childcare. My most recent family was with a babygirl since she was 3 months old till two years old. The parent is out of work so now I am looking for something new. I am available Full-Time Or Part-Time till 5 pm. I have experience with infants and older children as well with references available upon request. ( Also experienced with potty training) I really honestly enjoy the beauty of children and interacting with them. I love reading with them, singing, dancing playing play dough & whatever other toys they like as well as blowing bubbles :) I am very responsible, my mother was very careful with me as a child, as far as watching me so I would not get hurt and I am the same way with the children I watch. I am very attentive and hands on.    ",

If you reading this then you are in need of a babysitter. 
I am willing to babysit your child inside my house. I am taking on all ages of children including infants. 
I have a 1 1/2 old toddler son. He enjoys playing and having fun with other children. We also do learning and reading time as well. There are a ton of toys for play as well as educational here.
I am more than willing to set up nanny cams or do FaceTime so you can make sure that your child is in good hands.
I live across the street from a really big park and I take my son there every day to play. 

Who am I?
I am a 32 years old Hispanic/African American woman. I am employed with Delta Air Lines as a Reservation Specialist ✈️.  I am currently on extended leave because I have had some bad experiences with babysitters watching my son. A good babysitter is really hard to find. I prefer to stay at home until my child is able to communicate with me about what's going on in his day. I refuse to put my child in a day care. My husband works so I have the opportunity to stay home and take care of our child. 
 
I'm looking to help out a mom who's looking for reliable trustworthy childcare. 
I have state and federal background clearances and am more than willing to submit to a drug test if needed.

Hello!

I am a working mom with a Monday-Friday 9-5 position. My weekends consist of lots of r&r and catching up on household chores 🙂 

Looking to make some extra income babysitting Friday evenings-Sunday evenings. If you need a sitter for a night out, a Saturday shift, or that big interview I am happy to offer my services. 

My home is Vegetarian/Gluten Free/Dairy Free but I will accommodate your child as I'm 10 years in and understand how finnicky little ones can be!

My home is a very safe and very clean environment where you can be comfortable knowing your child will be loved like my own while in my care. 

I encourage you to stop by, meet me and my family and add me on social sites so you can learn more about me! I will only take up to two children at a time as this is what space allows.

Baths, dinner and snacks provided if need be. I only ask you send your children with adequate diapers/formula etc as I don't have any small ones of my own.

Hello Parents!

I am a very trustworthy, reliable and responsible person. Children and parents love how warm, nurturing and funny I am, and how much I challenge their imagination and creativity. I love doing arts and crafts and art or science project with the kids; being outside playing and taking nature walks, exploring and learning about animals and plants we see; reading lots of books during the day; playing with stimulating toys and creating our own games and toys. 

I am First Aid and CPR certified, a lifeguard, bilingual English/Spanish, college educated (BA Psychology and Childhood Development). I am experienced with all age groups since newborns to preteens: bottle preparation and feeding, diapering, meal preparation, nap time, bath, homework, etc according to the child's age. 

Let me know the schedule you're looking for, some details about your child and your availability for a meeting. Thank you!

Hello families,

I am here seeking a great nanny opportunity. The only thing is that I've never held an actual nanny position. I am seeking a family that goes off of my baby sitting experience and the energy I give off when I am in your presence for an interview.

I am 28 and helped raise my now 15 year old sister and now 4 year old brother. I have experience with infants to 12 year olds but I rather start my nanny experience with a family with a younger child. I have also been the baby sitter for family and friends of the family. I never knew where to begin with a nanny gig because most families or nanny companies required applicants to have at least one year of verifiable experience being an actual nanny. I have family and my mentor that's been in my life from 9 years old until now that is willing to speak with anyone about how I am with and/or around children.

If you would like to reach please do so an we can go from there.

Thank You    ",

QUEENS CENTER OF THE ARTS
at Innovations In Creative Arts offers an amazing After School Time Program.

From One day, to three days, five days, or all six days per week, children have the opportunity to learn through real creative activities with historical content. How many talents, inventors, brilliant people should they know about, be inspired by, relate to? People who look just like them and perhaps walked the same streets as they do now?

Not just babysitting, your child can choose between two major creative, martial arts, literary, science, cooking, performance arts, etc. activities each day and have the time to fully explore and engage in the learning process. Learning takes time, putting it all together and seeing the connection between things also takes time. At Queens Center of the Arts, that's what we're all about - Real Kids, Real Activities, Real Artists and Certified Professionals teaching, mentoring, and encouraging. 

Registration is now open for September. Visit the website or stop in and visit. Come see what we're all about and what makes our program unique and valuable.    ",

Hello, We are moving, and the hardest part is leaving behind our nanny, Emelie. 
Emelie has taken care of our son for over 2 years, and I cannot recommend her more highly. Emelie is calm, kind, reliable, responsible, self-motivated, fun, and loving. 
Everyday, Emelie shows up on time and ready to take my son out to the park, to meet friends, play... she is the leader which is so great. My son has a great time, is fed healthy meals, is bathed, and napped by the time I get home. Emelie is a pleasure to be around, and I trust her completely. Also a bonus is that she knows lots of activities for babies and toddlers in Brooklyn Heights, Cobble Hill, Carroll Gardens, and Boerum Hill. She lives in Brooklyn and was never late for work even once.
Emelie is open to full or part time work (minimum 30 hours per week).

I am writing this on behalf of our previous full time nanny Durga, who worked with us from September 2015 until July 2017.

When Durga started with us, our toddler boy was six months old.     Then in May 2017 we had a baby girl, and Durga helped with both our toddler boy and our baby girl.

Durga is seeking a full time job as a live-out nanny in Manhattan.    She has CPR training from the American Heart Association, and has nanny training.     I can attest she was a loving, caring nanny for our two kids.       She took care of all the children's related work (children's laundry, food preparation, feeding, visits to the park and to the children's library, etc).     We hope Durga will continue to visit us on occasion to look up the kids, as my toddler boy has much affection for her.   

Durga can be reached directly via telephone or text message at

We are trying to help our wonderful nanny Maiya find a new family because we are relocating to Los Angeles. Maiya has been with us for 10 months since our son was 4.5 months old. She is loving, energetic, responsible, engaging and very flexible. This is our first child so I was nervous about leaving him with anyone but Maiya is truly amazing. Oliver adores her (as do we) and we trust her completely. Anytime we need help on the weekends or have to stay late at work Maiya is always there ready to help in anyway she can. She is terrific with kids of all ages--she was a pro when Oliver was a baby and has managed to keep up with him even now that he is a crazy running toddler. We absolutely want to make sure that she goes on to work for a family that appreciates all she brings to their children's and their lives. Please feel free to contact me  if you or anyone you know is in need she can start July 1st and maybe even a bit earlier. She can work in Manhattan between 9-5

Hello, We are moving, and the hardest part is leaving behind our nanny, Emelie. 
Emelie has taken care of our son for over 2 years, and I cannot recommend her more highly. Emelie is calm, kind, reliable, responsible, self-motivated, fun, and loving. 
Everyday, Emelie shows up on time and ready to take my son out to the park, to meet friends, play... she is the leader which is so great. My son has a great time, is fed healthy meals, is bathed, and napped by the time I get home. Emelie is a pleasure to be around, and I trust her completely. Also a bonus is that she knows lots of activities for babies and toddlers in Brooklyn Heights, Cobble Hill, Carroll Gardens, and Boerum Hill. She lives in Brooklyn and was never late for work even once.
Emelie is open to full or part time work (minimum 30 hours per week).

Hello!
My name is Miyah and I have been a nanny for going on six years now. I have cared for and helped raise two infants up to three years old. I now have a six month old and I'm looking to go back to work full time.
My daughter is in daycare full time during the week so Monday through Friday would be an ideal situation for me.
I'm a very hands on nanny. Children love me and take to me so well. Not only do I care for the babies I cook, clean and set up play dates for them to enjoy. I'm also very experienced with finding fun things in the area for children to do, no matter where you live.
I love arts and crafts for the babies, story time and educational games, whether I come up with them or they are provided.
I believe communfication is key and if there is anything you feel uncomfortable with I prefer you lay it out and we can get through it together. 
I'm open to new recipes, different ways of teaching the children or any classes that must be taken
Please give me a call and we can set up a time to meet.

Hello!

I am a high school English teacher who is interested in tutoring on weekdays.

I have taught 9th and 10th grade English for six years, but I previously taught middle school English for three years and have worked in elementary classrooms, as well. I possess a Master's from Teachers College in 1st-6th grade education. Over the years, I have worked with and tutored students of all ages. I have also taught multiple SAT Verbal courses.

I am most able to assist students with writing, reading comprehension, and/or vocabulary skills; I am also equipped to prepare a teenager for the ACT/SAT verbal sections or the ACT/SAT English test. In my past tutoring experience, I have also helped students with basic middle and grammar school math, science, history, and Spanish.

I take tutoring as seriously as I take my full-time teaching job and always show up on time and prepared.

My rate is $95/hr. Upon request, I can provide my resume and/or references from my department chair and principal. 

Please let me know if you would like to arrange a phone or in-person meeting.

Best,
Brooke    ",

Dear Sir/Madam:

My name is Kenisia Facey, 33 years of age and of Jamaican nationality. I am legal to work and travel in and outside the United State. I also possess a N.Y State driver's license.
I am also CPR certified for infants children and adults.

I am seeking a Full-time Nanny position. 

I am a responsible, capable, reliable, non-smoking, energetic and self-motivated individual. I really enjoy working with children as their simple approach to everyday life intrigues me and offers me a chance to learn from them. I take my responsibilities very seriously and assure you of my honesty and integrity.

For over 8 years I have worked as a nanny. I have particular experience with newborns to 14 years of age and with multiple sets of twins. I have cared for children with special needs, medical conditions and food allergies. I also understand Jewish Dietary Laws and believe that my experience would make me a suitable applicant for the available vacancy. 
I hope you find my application of interest and I would be pleased to attend an interview at your convenience.

References are available on request. 

Yours sincerely

Kenisia Facey

Help for mothers who feel overwhelmed 

Hello I know you feel overwhelmed. Working & taking care of kids, you find yourself often anxious and worried. You feel as if there's not enough hours in the day to get it all done. Between the demands at work to the demands at home there's never any time for you. Yet you see some moms who seem to have it all the together the Martha stwarts of the world. How the heck do these women do it. Well it starts with a community of help. I want to start just such a community and I want to help mothers like myself figure out how to be their best selves. I'm on a journey of growth and finding happiness. I would love to help others get on their own journies. This may start small who knows if anyone will join in but, if you want help I'm here to offer it for free no money needed all you need to bring is just a willingness to except help and stay positive in your heart.

A very caring & loving person (our kids adore her) she was very reliable in all of her domestic responsibilities, such as cooking, light cleaning, doing the laundry, etc.  Essentially, she has been responsible for raising my two girls while they were growing up and I was preoccupied with my business during the work week. 
If you are looking for a mature, trustworthy, warm and sincere caretaker, you will love our nanny! 

Please feel free to contact me if you or anyone you know is in need; she can start immediately.  I would be happy to speak in more detail about her qualifications and will pass along her contact info for an interview. 

Thank you!
