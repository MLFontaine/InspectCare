Hello everyone:

My name is Lee and I am currently a Special Needs Nanny for a child in Park Slope. I have been working with him for 10 years and I am available for date night sitting and overnights. I am available all day Monday and on the weekends. I am bilingual English Spanish and have a complete background check as I work for 2 agencies. I am also a personal assistant in my spare time. Set up appointments, accompany to appointments run errands, like post office etc. I am very good on the phone in resolving issues been doing this for years!

I am warm college educated and have experience with children who are not on the spectrum. My goal is to enrich your child's life and to teach them something everyday. I would love to teach a child Spanish, proper Spanish no slang. I learned Spanish at home and English in school. Spanish opens up a whole new world for you!

I am very health conscious and love cooking healthy foods, and making healthy drinks. NO chips, NO fast foods, NO cola NO juice. Exercise is very important to me and would not mind doing Zumba with your children or outdoor activities. Anything to keep them active. I also love reading and can read to them in English or Spanish whatever you would like.

I have first aide training and CPR and AED I am being constantly trained by both agencies, I also have experience with Diabetics and children with Down Syndrome. I know the signs of low blood sugar and how to handle the situation should it arise. I know how to check sugar with machine too and know about blood pressure etc. Recently got evaluated 2 times back to back and passed.

Looking forward to hearing from you,

Hi Everyone

My name is Lee and I'm a Life Skills Coach for Special Needs children. I'm bilingual English and Spanish and have AED first aid and CPR. I also have a current background check. I am looking for part time work with a toddler or younger as I have experience with these kids also.

My typical day would consist of going to the library for reading flash cards and socialization. Can take to the museum and the park weather permitting. I can teach Spanish if you'd like. Looking to work in many places. Williamsburg Park Slope UWS LES East Village etc.


My schedule is:

Mondays off

Tuesday's thru Fridays available until 2:30pm.

AHLOOOOHAAAA!!!

It is a pleasure to meet you via the internet! Say's who? Crystal Violet. I have cared for infants, toddlers, preschoolers and middle school aged kids students in child care programs, public schools, private schools and summer camps. I have worked at Bright Horizon as an Assistant Teacher nurturing infants, helping them with tummy, play, read and sleep time. Previously I worked as a Para where I catered to one student and guided the class on daily meditations. I have mentored groups of students on meditations, nature walks and art activities between the ages of 3-12 at OASIS Summer Camp, Children's Art & Science Workshop Camp, Don Pedro Albizo Campus Public School and Kipp Infinity Charter School. I am now looking to build healthy relationships with children in the comfort of their homes. If you are looking for someone to help your kids with light homework, yoga, meditation, art activities, light meals and light cleaning after children...well then I always say if it's meant to be then it's meant to be. Preferably I would like to care for children between 6 months- ten years of age up to three children in total. If this resonates with you we can go into details and I can forward you my resume and we can have a talk via skype or any other video chat.

Ciao!    "

We are a family based daycare. Dedicating each and everyday to nourish young children's minds and hearts with love, as if they've never left home. 

Because we are family based, children here come in to their second home.

Here we not only care for your children, but we try to teach them things that you as a parent would want to nourish upon your children. We understand that its hard enough going to work and having to leave them behind, so we offer services like text updates and picture updates. So that you can feel calm knowing that your children are doing wonderfully. 

Our daily routines include and are not limited to.. breakfast, story time, play time, potty time, lunch, nap time, sing song time, art time, ABC's and 123's and lots of hugs in between. 


Our days begin at 6am and end at 8pm (EXTRA HOURS ARE AVAILABLE) We also offer weekend and Overnight. (at an extra rate). Our children's ages range from 12 months - 5 yrs old.

Family DayCare $25/day,https://newyork.craigslist.org/que/kid/d/family-daycare-25-day/6306412568.html,Jackson Heights,"
        
With 9 years experience with children, currently offering daycare services. With over 20 different references (upon request) you can rest assure that your child/children will be in the EXCELLENT care. 

We are a family based daycare. Dedicating each and everyday to nourish young children's minds and hearts with love, as if they've never left home. 

Because we are family based, children here come in to their second home. They nap on beds not cots, they have breakfast, lunch and dinner at the kitchen table with all their friends, they learn to be kind to each other, to say please and thank you, to play together as friends and most importantly to be confident! Here we not only care for your children, but we try to teach them things that you as a parent would want to nourish upon your children. We understand that its hard enough going to work and having to leave them behind, so we offer services like text updates and picture updates. So that you can feel calm knowing that your children are doing wonderfully. 

Our daily routines include and are not limited to.. breakfast, story time, play time, potty time, lunch, nap time, sing song time, art time, ABC's and 123's and lots of hugs in between. 


Our days begin at 6am and end at 8pm. (EXTRA HOURS ARE AVAILABLE) We also offer weekend and Overnight. (at an extra rate). Our children's ages range from 12 months - 5 yrs old.  



I am CPR certified, DayCare provider certified and Assistant Teacher certification for Pre-K and Kindergarden. 

To schedule an interview or inquire about our services you may contact me at

Hi

My typical day would consist of going to the library for lots of reading flash cards and socialization. Can take to the museum and the park weather permitting. I can also teach Spanish if you'd like. I'm a warm fit woman who's into eating healthy and exercising. Also love to cook healthy foods.


My schedule is:

Tuesday's thru Fridays available until 2:30pm.

Available most weekends too.

I'm a warm college educated woman who has a passion for all children and I'm fit and cook healthy meals.

Warm regards, Lee    "

My name is Lee and I'm a Life Skills Coach for Special Needs children. I'm bilingual English and Spanish and have AED first aid and CPR. I also have a current background check. I am looking for part time work with a toddler or younger as I have experience with these kids also. 

Right now I'm working with 2 children in Windsor Terrace in the mornings and tomorrow will be my last day. One goes back to school and their regular Nanny will pick him up. Currently looking to help another family.

My typical day would consist of going to the library for reading flash cards and socialization. Can take to the museum and the park weather permitting. I can teach Spanish if you'd like. Looking to work in many places. Williamsburg Park Slope UWS LES East Village etc.


My schedule is:

Mondays off

Tuesday's thru Fridays available until 2:30pm.

I'm a warm college educated woman who has a passion for all children and I'm fit and cook healthy meals.

You have a babysitter and you have a housekeeper.  It should be easier, but it's not.  Everyday your ""to-do"" list grows - and you mean well, but it's never really addressed in a timely manner.  Friday night rolls around, the kids are loved up, bathed and in bed - but instead of breathing a sigh of relief and relaxing into the weekend you turn to the list and realize just how many errands you're going to be running in addition to the usual onslaught of Saturday/Sunday kiddo activities.  It might be a fun weekend, but what you need is the opportunity to pause and recharge.  It's not going to happen because you're going to be buying groceries, shopping for gifts, wrapping gifts, finding items for your child's project, hunting down stuff your housekeeper needs, locating items that your babysitter wants, managing whatever it is that your husband lovingly put on your plate, researching the thing that your mom asked you about and sorting out calendar conflicts.

My clients in the past have come from three camps - busy professionals with families working high-net, time-intensive jobs that require a tremendous amount of focus and don't allow for a relaxed, comfortable handling of house management, single professionals who don't have families but have business-related social commitments that don't allow them to tend to household matters and busy couples for whom philanthropy, travel and community development are the primary focus of their time. 

My appeal today is to the first category - any working mom who would appreciate mental relief and the ability to be more present.  My references are stellar and would assert that I add value - I'll take on errands, tasks and the minutiae that accumulates daily.  My work is provided both on-site and off - and my clients are encouraged to offload tasks from their head space to mine 24/7 via email with the guarantee that they'll be handled in a timely manner.  I'm warm, fun, quietly efficient and charmingly tenacious- I can be trusted to act on your behalf in a way that wins admiration for you and your ""brand.""

Contact me so that we can have a chat about the frustrations you're experiencing and how I might be helpful.  I have a 10-hour weekly minimum, but you'll find that just 10 hours of my time will make a tremendous difference in your time-crunched life!    "

Safe, reliable, loving,
 fun, childcare. Crafts and learning.

I am versed in first aid/ infant..child adult cpr.

We do a craft everyday.
We have storytime reading twice a day.
We play outside, whether permiting.
I take kids on daily trips to local library, playcenters, local free events.

No one is in my home 5am-7pm, but children.

My rates are great.
I have tons of references.

I am available all hours (day & nights) and also provide infant care. Contact for rates.

My rates for daytime care are as followed:
$28 a day 8:00am-5pm full time.

Huge Sibling discount.
Will work out price with parents...i know childcare is a fortune at some places or you're not getting safe quality care from these ""Babysitters""!
I have a huge wonderful list of past children & parent references. If a babysitter cant give you atleast 10 non family references-BEWARE, something is very wrong. If they havent resided in the same dwelling consistly beware. If their bathroom or car is old & dirty, Beware. These are all signs of someone irresponsible.
 I invite people to look at my bathroom, kitchen, etc...it says alot about a person. If they open their door in pj's and hair a wreck, thats another sign to beware of. What I'm saying is ""Be selective"" Best way to figure out who a person is, is Facebook. Look them up and see how they interact with others and whos on their friends list, the comments they or their friends leave-SAY ALOT ABOUT WHO THEY ARE!  If they drive a crap box car-sadly they are watching kids for a few bucks and are broke. 
Im not judgemental, just realistic!

I have a huge wonderful list of past children & parent references. If a babysitter cant give you atleast 10 non family references-BEWARE, something is very wrong. If they havent resided in the same dwelling consistly beware. If their bathroom or car is old & dirty, Beware. These are all signs of someone irresponsible.
 I invite people to look at my bathroom, kitchen, etc...it says alot about a person. If they open their door in pj's and hair a wreck, thats another sign to beware of. What I'm saying is ""Be selective"" Best way to figure out who a person is, is Facebook. Look them up and see how they interact with others and whos on their friends list, the comments they or their friends leave-SAY ALOT ABOUT WHO THEY ARE!  If they drive a crap box car-sadly they are watching kids for a few bucks and are broke. 
Im not judgemental, just realistic!

Parents provide lunch or i will for an extra $2 a day

(Choice of pizza, all beef hotdog, white meat chicken tenders, burger or grill cheese served with fruit slices and a veggie portion)

I provide breakfast, 2-3 healthy snacks, water, juice per day...(parent permiting, a cookie or sweet a day)

COMING VERY SOON

See the exciting, fun cover of 

""THE HIPPO CAMPUS""

THE INTERACTIVE BRAIN BOOK:
Fun Learning for Science Lovers

pic.twitter.com/RWMA6L9lih


...and enjoy its dynamic, fast-paced book trailer here-> 



Affordable.  Soon Available in Hard Cover, Soft Cover and
all Digital Formats.
This is the beginning of a lifetime science adventure for your children...
pictorial, serious, humorous, with lots of interactive elements, so it's not 
only reading, there's something for your young readers to do on every page.

And there's even a Graduation ""ceremony"" for young readers plus
a rhyming Graduation Song.

BONUSES: The book includes TWO POSTERS to cut out
and hang up.  These are suitable for kids to hang up in their
rooms, for Science Teachers to post on school bulletin boards,
for Medical School Libraries to post, for Neuroscientists
to hang in their Laboratories, and so forth.

These Posters are both instructive and humorous. While the book
itself engages and challenges a child's mind to learn all about
the wonderful human brain and perhaps, some day, to work in
healthcare, neurosurgery, neuroscience, and even the arts.

The book was created by Helen Borel, RN,MFA,PhD
PsychoTherapist, PsychoAnalyst, Writer

More about Dr. Borel at her website
PsychDocNYC.com
Get in touch there to be notified when
the book is available. Be one of the first parents
to see your children's eyes light up with pleasure
and amazement as they experience ""THE HIPPO CAMPUS"".

Wonderful Babysitter,https://newyork.craigslist.org/lgi/kid/d/wonderful-babysitter/6304294831.html,Valley Stream,"
        
Hi, I'm Aaliyah. With an extensive background in babysitting for children of all ages--coupled with my college coursework in early education and my fun-loving and caring personality--I am confident that I can provide excellent childcare to your family.
As a freshman at Nassau Community College, I am pursuing a degree in Early Childhood Education due to my love of working with children. For the past four years, I have served as a babysitter to the same family, for which I am happy to provide a reference. This family included children from infancy through age 11. From preparing healthy snacks and changing diapers to playing at the park and building forts, I am enthusiastic and supportive in every aspect of caring for children. Additionally, I have experience helping young children through separation anxiety situations, using distraction and refocusing techniques to help kids through those tough emotions.
My previous experience also includes an ongoing summer camp counselor position at the local YMCA for four consecutive summers, providing support and guidance to elementary-aged children in the areas of sports, swimming, nature walks, cooking, and social group interactions.
I do not drive; however, I will always be on time and enthusiastic to start my working day. I am fun, loving, caring and very social. 
My babysitting skills and experience, along with my positive attitude and friendly nature, position me to excel in this role. I would love the opportunity to meet your family and discuss my qualifications in more detail.

Loving and Devoted Nanny Seeking Full-Time Live-in Nanny Position,https://newyork.craigslist.org/fct/kid/d/loving-and-devoted-nanny/6298468081.html,"Westport, Darien, New Canaan, Greenwich","
        
Good Day,

How are you? I am hoping to find a long term live-in nanny position with a wonderful family. Offering 15+ years experience and proficiency in assimilating into a new family culture. Skilled in creating schedules, following commitments and maintaining routines. Bringing a compassionate childcare approach and exceptional child development skills to contribute to the family. My years of experience and training have fostered my ability to develop close relationships with both children and families. I have excellent communication skills, relate well to people and converse in a polite and courteous manner. I have a can do attitude and take great pride in everything I do. 

My experience has been working with families in New York City, Southampton, Long Island and Massachusetts. My last live-in nanny position was in Framingham, MA. I stayed with the family for eight wonderful years. Caring for a very sweet boy who was three years old when I arrived. At this present time he is starting his second year of college. I'm so proud of him!

I have found my nanny profession to be a very rewarding experience. I love to watch children learn and grow, while teaching them kindness, sharing, compassion and love. Always learning from children I'm working with everyday. I admire children's endless energy, honesty, creativity, flexibility and resilience. Knowing that my job is to help children achieve their full potential and help them feel good about themselves, brings a huge smile to my face.

I am a well mannered, articulate and responsible nanny with a great deal of experience and interest in children and their development. A confident child carer who is loving and devoted to her job.
Working with children is my true passion. When you are doing something you love, you truly shine. I always go above and beyond in my job. I hope to build a strong relationship and trust with my next family. With a strong foundation and open communication, the children can have an exceptional nanny as they grow and mature.

Some of my core competencies are being reliable, patient, trustworthy, organized and creative. A wonderful cook who has a passion for preparing and cooking healthy food. Also very, flexible with my time. I will be happy to help with light housekeeping and errands need be. I do have my own car with a great driving history.
I can provide you with references upon request and answer any questions you may have. Thank you very much for your time!
Please feel free to email me at your convenience. I will get back to you as soon as possible.

All the best to you and your family!

Sincerely, Janna Michele    "

"***Hire our INCREDIBLE NANNY - Full or Part Time, Live-In***",https://newyork.craigslist.org/fct/kid/d/hire-our-incredible-nanny/6297391185.html,"Wilton, CT","
        
Our incredible Filipina nanny, who has been with us for over 17 years, is looking for a new full or part-time live-in nanny position in the Fairfield County area.   She is truly amazing - no words can really do her justice.  Since both my husband and I work, we were really in need of help, and throughout the years, Maria Theresa has been everything we could have asked for.   She is the kind of nanny that would braid our daughters' hair everyday before school, wake up early to cook special breakfasts on our children's birthdays, and hand-make ornaments for the Christmas tree each year.  Over the years, she has truly become part of our family and a loving ""aunt"" to our three children.  Now that our kids are grown up (our two eldest are off to college, youngest in high school), though, we have realized we unfortunately no longer need a full-time nanny at home.  Therefore, we are trying to find her a part or full time nannying position with another family in the Fairfield County area.  

Maria Theresa is one of the most loving, patient, and genuinely caring people we have ever known.  She is college educated and an excellent cook.  We cannot recommend her more highly.  

She is looking for a position in Fairfield County or Manhattan areas with mainly childcare duties (light housekeeping and cooking are ok, but she would like the focus of her job to be taking care of the children).    Of note, she does NOT drive.  

Please call Maria Theresa directly on her cell phone at 
 
.  If you would like to speak with us (the family), please send us an email using the Craigslist email address.  We would be more than happy to answer any questions you might have, either via email or on the phone.  Thank you!

EXPECTING A BABY & SEEKING AFFORDABLE CHILD CARE IN MURRAY HILL?,https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/kid/d/expecting-baby-seeking/6292882974.html,Murray Hill,"
        
We are expectant professional parents, baby due in late January, seeking to meet similarly situated expectant parents to plan for a nanny share. 

We are posting this now because we are learning how difficult and expensive trustworthy childcare is to secure. Because we both work long hours, it appears that most group childcare will be impractical for us. (Most childcare facilities close at 6pm or so.) The cost of a private nanny seems prohibitive and, perhaps, even undesirable. So we are seeking to meet other expectant parents who are in a similar situation and, perhaps, agree to share a nanny in the neighborhood. 

We live at 40th street and Second Avenue and looking to meet another family -very- close by to us: We are thinking of an area bounded north by 44rd Street and south by 37th Street, and from First Avenue to Third Avenue. We hope to meet a happy, thoughtful, professional married couple for this purpose.

Please write to us if this seems an arrangement you may be interested in. Please also feel free to share any information or advice on this subject that you may have. We would very much appreciate it.

Hello hello,

I am Nicole, sunflower by day analytical artist by night.

With 3 Nieces and 3 Nephews, aged 12, 8, 4, 3,3, and 8 months I have managed to rack up a good amount of care taking experience as well as the patience of a saint :) and since you can't choose your family, it teaches you to love and care unconditionally - love that as extended to few other family and friends whose children I've had the opportunity to care for whilst back home in South Africa.

I would love to be able to do the same while here in America while I get to explore and get to experience my first white Christmas.

What I have to offer :

Hugs (a lot of them), as well as care, structure, discipline and a great environment to learn and grow. I understand that all children have different personalities and I endeavor to treat them accordingly.

I am constantly amazed at children's ability to absorb information so easily at a young age and thus always use every activity as an opportunity to teach. I believe that my background as a graphic designer combined with my love for education has allowed for me to be able to use lateral thinking and creativity as an advantage in advancing little humans, not only in developing their minds but developing their personalities too.

If you are interested in hiring me please do not hesitate to contact me at any time, I am available as live in / live out at $20 an hour

BABYSITTER CERTIFIED IN CHILDCARE/CPR AT YOUR SERVICE!,https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/kid/d/babysitter-certified-in/6285414155.html,Lower East Side,"
        
Hello Parents!

First, a little about myself. Im 24 years of age, educated & YES I am certified to take care of children! I enjoy working with children, which is why I have about 5 years working in daycares, and home babysitting. As I said before I am certified, along with CPR/First aid as well. I have a background check and have been finger printed also so your little one(s) are in good hands. I work anywhere in the Bronx or Manhattan. I am looking for a part time or full-time babysitting/nanny position. I work with children of ages, Infant to 12 yrs old. I also have experience with all types of children, For example, Adhd, handcap, autistic. 👍 I love writing and teaching children. I cant forget sports, I enjoy mainly baseball but Im always open to other sports too.  I hope this helped you get an idea about myself a little. 

Payments- I don't have a specific rate, I usually let the parents have a set rate or we work on it, but please keep in mind that I also won't work for any less than what my services deserve. 

PS, I'm Bilingual! I speak both English and Spanish. Thats always a plus! 

Thank you for reading! Good luck on your babysitter hunt!!    "

Hello hello,

I am Nicole, sunflower by day analytical artist by night.

With 3 Nieces and 3 Nephews, aged 12, 8, 4, 3,3, and 8 months I have managed to rack up a good amount of care taking experience as well as the patience of a saint :) and since you can't choose your family, it teaches you to love and care unconditionally - love that as extended to few other family and friends whose children I've had the opportunity to care for whilst back home in South Africa.

I would love to be able to do the same while here in America while I get to explore and get to experience my first white Christmas.

What I have to offer :

Hugs (a lot of them), as well as care, structure, discipline and a great environment to learn and grow. I understand that all children have different personalities and I endeavor to treat them accordingly.

I am constantly amazed at children's ability to absorb information so easily at a young age and thus always use every activity as an opportunity to teach. I believe that my background as a graphic designer combined with my love for education has allowed for me to be able to use lateral thinking and creativity as an advantage in advancing little humans, not only in developing their minds but developing their personalities too.

If you are interested in hiring me please do not hesitate to contact me at any time, I am available as live in / live out at $20 an hour

Hello, Welcome to Sunshine Daycare. My name is Vanessa Liang. I provide a family daycare that is exceptionally convenient, safe, fun for children of all ages. We have teachers and students in different ethnicities and they learn very well to cooperate with each other.  The teachers teach with pride and patience for the children to learn mannerism and develop social skills. I believe this will assist them to get a jump start in early life. We provide the children with daily healthy food, fun activities and learning environment in the classroom. We also do offer pickup service.  Our rates are very affordable and the best in the area. I have many references from our customers from providing outstanding service. Please feel free to contact me if you should have any questions. I look forward to speaking with you all.

My daycare hours are Mon-Fri 8am-6pm, with some flexibility if needed.
Our daily activities include: story time, arts and crafts, circle time, exercising, music and dance, outdoor fun in a nearby play area. We have weekly learning themes which include: science experiments, letters, numbers, shapes, colors, seasons, holidays, fire safety, friendship, and so much more.

I provide breakfast and lunch which are prepared daily, as well as afternoon snack. We are located in College Point, very close to Flushing.

We pick up after school from PS 29 and PS 129

We learn, play and have lots of fun!
Thank you,
Sunshine Daycare

Exceptional Nanny/babysitter available for part-time childcare


Recently my nanny has gone to a part time schedule
given my littlest daughter entered kindergarten.  She is looking to supplement working with our
family with other babysitting job(s). Her availability is M-F, 7:00 am-1:00 pm. 
Ideally she would like something regular, 2-5 days per week, but ad hoc is not out of the question.  Additionally, she is available for errands, organizing, and other tasks to ease your day to day. 

A little note about our Nanny. She has worked with us for 8 years.  My three daughters, ages 10, 9, and 5, adore her and are extremely attached.   She is kind, caring, responsible, fun, yet appropriately
stern when needed.  Childcare is not a part time gig for her.  Prior to working
with our family, she worked for another family and a day care for a few years.  We trust her explicitly with our children, 2 dogs, vehicle, personal documents, etc.  I think the world of our Nanny and have NO hesitation referring her.

QUEENS CENTER OF THE ARTS
at Innovations In Creative Arts offers an amazing After School Time Program.

From One day, to three days, five days, or all six days per week, children have the opportunity to learn through real creative activities with historical content.  How many talents, inventors, brilliant people should they know about, be inspired by, relate to?  People who look just like them and perhaps walked the same streets as they do now?

Not just babysitting, your child can choose between two major creative, martial arts, literary, science, cooking, performance arts, etc. activities each day and have the time to fully explore and engage in the learning process.  Learning takes time, putting it all together and seeing the connection between things also takes time. At Queens Center of the Arts, that's what we're all about - Real Kids, Real Activities, Real Artists and Certified Professionals teaching, mentoring, and encouraging. 

Registration is now open for September.  Visit the website or stop in and visit. Come see what we're all about and what makes our program unique and valuable.  

Summer Hours: Tuesdays - Fridays 2:00pm - 7:30pm; Saturdays 10:00 - 7:30pm
September - June:  Mondays - Fridays 2:00pm - 8:00pm; Saturdays 9:30am - 8:00pm

Part-Time Family Assistant will GET YOU SORTED!,https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/kid/d/part-time-family-assistant/6296430994.html,Manhattan,"
        
When's the last time you were able to read a book without a ""to-do"" list on your conscience?

I'm an accomplished PA hoping to serve a family that needs part-time assistance.  I'm currently listed with a top NYC staffing agency and have ten years of experience offering long-term service.  My references are stellar - nab me on Craig's List and save yourself the 15% gross salary fee! 

I'm warm, pleasant and pride myself on making my families happy.  If you know you could use a hand, but balk at the notion of bringing someone on board who'll require an orientation and will be privy to the specifics of your chaos - I'm your girl.  I'm a quick study and will work quickly towards a system that allows me to anticipate need.

I provide both on-site and virtual assistance - clients usually need a mix of both.  You'd have the freedom to offload tasks and requests 24/7 as they enter your head space and be assured that you're delegating to someone who will follow-through.  I'm sharing the standard list of tasks that I provide - it becomes more family-specific over time:
     
     Schedule and oversee home repairs
     Schedule and oversee home maintenance
     Purchase household equipment, supplies and services
     Purchase groceries
     Create and maintain organizational systems
     Liaise with household suppliers, vendors, colleagues, clients
     Manage personal calendar
     Manage personal correspondence (daily, holiday)
     Hire/ supervise/ support/ terminate staff (nannies, housekeepers, groundskeepers, tutors)
     Manage designated projects
     Manage personal appointments
     Arrange travel plans/ itineraries/ accommodations
     Arrange dinner reservations
     Assist with event/ party planning
     Assist with personal shopping (errands, gifts, holidays)
     Prepare and oversee mailings
     Assist with bill payment
     Assist with online sale of household items
     Perform internet research

Let me know how I can help you find time in your day - I'll get you sorted!    "

Also just got company evaluation where I was observed working with child and got great evaluation! I am warm and have a passion to see Special Needs children be more independent but also for any child to make progress, Right now with the toddler we are doing ABC's with flash cards and working on colors and matching cards and counting and he has done a lot of progress with everything I am teaching him and with his languages skills!

Looking forward to hearing from you,

Hi

 I'm a Special Needs Nanny looking for more work. I have CPR AED and first aid training. I'm also bilingual English and Spanish and have been working with the same family in Park Slope 10 years. Also work with a toddler who is not Special Needs was working with a 10 month old who is sadly moving to another state. I am now available Mondays for date night 

I'm also available most weekends. I have 2 complete background checks as I work for 2 agencies and they require this to work with any child. Medicaid requires it. Also just got company evaluation where I was observed working with child and got great evaluation! I am warm and have a passion to see Special Needs children be more independent but also for any child to make progress, Right now with the toddler we are doing ABC's with flash cards and working on colors and matching cards and counting and he has done a lot of progress with everything I am teaching him and with his languages skills!

Looking forward to hearing from you,

Expectant Prof. Parents Due 1/19 Seek Same for Very Close Nanny Share,https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/kid/d/expectant-prof-parents-due-1/6290991847.html,Murray Hill,"
        
We are posting this now because are learning how expensive trustworthy childcare is to secure. Because we both work long hours, it appears that most group childcare will be impractical for us. (Most childcare facilities close at 6pm or so.) The cost of a private nanny seems prohibitive and, perhaps, even undesirable. So we are seeking to meet other expectant parents who are in a similar situation and, perhaps, agree to share a nanny in the neighborhood. 

We live at 40th street and Second Avenue and looking to meet another family -very- close by to us: We are thinking of an area bounded north by 43rd Street and south by 38th Street, and from First Avenue to Third Avenue. We hope to meet a happy, thoughtful, professional married couple for this purpose.

Please write to us if this seems an arrangement you may be interested in. Please also feel free to share any information or advice on this subject that you may have. We would very much appreciate it.

I have taught all levels of high school English for over 20 years, but also have some middle-school English experience. I have taught college classes as an adjunct, as well. I possess a Master's from Teachers College in English Education and am certified to teach English K-12. Over the years, I have worked with and tutored students of all ages and ability levels. I have also taught multiple SAT Verbal courses, as well as COOP and TACHS test prep.

I am able to assist students with writing, reading comprehension, and/or vocabulary skills; I am also equipped to prepare a teenager for the ACT/SAT verbal sections or the ACT/SAT English test. 

I take tutoring as seriously as I take my full-time teaching job and always show up fully prepared.  

My rate is $65/hr. Upon request, I can provide my resume and/or references from my department chair and principal. 

Please let me know if you would like to arrange a meeting.

Best,
Kitty    "

Hello! 

My name is Sara; I have been a nanny and sitter for over ten years. I am 23 years old, and am very fun-loving and energetic. I've taken care of children from ages ranging from 8 months to 14 years old. I really enjoy spending time with kids and helping parents add a little more peace and sanity to their everyday life. I love sports, board games, writing, art -- I bond with children over tons of subjects and activities while ensuring the atmosphere is safe and that your child is cared for. 

I have experience in preparing meals, putting children to bed, including baths, teeth-brushing and telling stories, as well as helping with homework, chaperoning playdates, escorting to and from school, watching for multiple days and nights in a row, and so on. I also have a wide set of organization skills, and have arranged and kept track of appointments and meetings for both parents and children. 

My first language is English, my second language is French, and I can speak conversational Spanish. I can tutor French, English, math, science, and have no allergies to any animals and am available as well for pet-sitting or dog-walking. I also have experience as a Mother's Helper for when you just need that extra help with the kids. 

In addition, I have a BA from Hunter College (graduated 2016) and a TESOL certification. 

If you would like to contact me, you can reach me by e-mail. Otherwise, I can be reached either by texting or telephone at 
 
. I have a resume and references available upon request and I am happy to answer any questions you may have.  

I live in Queens, and I am willing to travel to Manhattan and Brooklyn. I'm looking to work a minimum of 20 hours a week. I am flexible with time and I'm free evenings and weekends also.  

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you. 

All the best,

In the simplest terms, Gold Materiam Montessori School provides educational child care. But our commitment to kids doesn't stop there. We are passionate about providing your children with the tools they need to be successful in all aspects of their lives.

A Stimulating Environment
Unlike traditional day care, a Montessori School education combines our strong preschool curriculum and a safe, stimulating environment to create meaningful experiences for your child every day.

Our Whole Child Educational Approach
By focusing on nurturing seven skill areas (including early literacy, logical thinking, problem solving, social understanding, physical coordination, creativity and positive character traits, such as cooperation and self-control) - an approach that we call our whole child education - we help your child develop the critical-thinking skills and intellectual curiosity that fuel success in his or her kindergarten classroom and beyond.

Active Learning through Highly Trained Teachers
Our dedicated and highly trained teachers focus on more than just reading, writing and arithmetic by also creating active learning experiences around character building, physical activity and social and emotional development.

$50 per hour lesson or

My guitar teachers had various styles, but the best ones actually asked me what ""I Wanted"" to learn and found ways to teach me, but also added a healthy dose of hard theory based practice that ""I didn't know I needed"". 

The worst ones simply gave me exercises to do and hurried me out of the room to get a paycheck. 

I truly care about sharing my knowledge and making my students better and creating an environment where they can explore their strengths and weaknesses.

developing imagination, taste, designing, drawing, playing ball, listening to fairy tales, 
eating a healhy and tasty meal, (children liked my cooking) so we became true friends and we are keeping in touch. 
I have excellent recommendations from this family. 

I am an architect, but for numerous years have been working with children of different ages and it has been wonderful! 
I have also studied children psychology for two years that has helped me too.

If You don't have time with household chores, I can help You with it.

Priority location would be Manhattan and areas, but it can be another place too, I'm flexible. 
My salary depends on a situation.it's flexible. 
I am available to discuss your expectations in an interview at your convenience.

Renaissance Manny / Male Nanny Available,https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/kid/d/renaissance-manny-male-nanny/6268078589.html,Upper West Side,"
        
If you've been searching for a nanny or babysitter here and you're hoping to find someone more educated, more experienced, and maybe a little more savvy than the status quo, then I'm your guy.

First, some highlights:
-- Highest honors in dual bachelor's degrees from a top-five art school. [education & sculpture]
-- Ivy League graduate study in education.
-- Graduate of well-known boarding preparatory high school. Served as prefect for two years.
-- Former nanny for two boys from a high-profile family in the financial district.
-- Former teacher in both private and public school settings, largely in gifted education.
-- Completely fluent in spoken and written French.

As for the Renaissance element: I play several instruments, I'm involved in the visual arts, and I used to be on an MTV program. All of these have made me a good fit for kids who think they're ""too cool"" for a nanny, by the way.

In addition, I practice a martial art, I'm active in athletics, and I'm a firm believer in spending time with children outdoors (just like Rousseau). I've published several papers on child development in peer-reviewed journals. I'm a natural autodidact and truly enjoy sharing my love of learning with my charges.

I have experience with both full- and part-time arrangements, and I'm open to either. I work well with all children, including tweens/teenagers, children with learning and behavioral differences, and introverted or otherwise unique kids. Being a male nanny is much more than a job for me--it's a testament to my deep interest in education and child development.

All of the above is detailed in my résumé, and I come with fantastic references, so send me an email and let's discuss the particulars of your situation!

I'm very much looking forward to hearing from you.

family with other babysitting job(s). Her availability is M-F, 7:00 am-1:00 pm. 
Ideally she would like something regular, 2-5 days per week, but ad hoc is not out of the question.  Additionally, she is available for errands, organizing, and other tasks to ease your day to day. 

A little note about our Nanny. She has worked with us for 8 years.  My three daughters, ages 10, 9, and 5, adore her and are extremely attached.   She is kind, caring, responsible, fun, yet appropriately
stern when needed.  Childcare is not a part time gig for her.  Prior to working
with our family, she worked for another family and a day care for a few years.  We trust her explicitly with our children, 2 dogs, vehicle, personal documents, etc.  I think the world of our Nanny and have NO hesitation referring her.

ARE YOU EXPECTING & SEEKING AFFORDABLE CHILD CARE IN MURRAY HILL?,https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/kid/d/are-you-expecting-seeking/6302038908.html,Murray Hill,"
        
We are expectant professional parents Due in late January, seeking to meet similarly situated expectant parents to plan fora Nanny Share. 

We are posting this now because are learning how expensive trustworthy childcare is to secure. Because we both work long hours, it appears that most group childcare will be impractical for us. (Most childcare facilities close at 6pm or so.) The cost of a private nanny seems prohibitive and, perhaps, even undesirable. So we are seeking to meet other expectant parents who are in a similar situation and, perhaps, agree to share a nanny in the neighborhood. 

We live at 40th street and Second Avenue and looking to meet another family -very- close by to us: We are thinking of an area bounded north by 44rd Street and south by 37th Street, and from First Avenue to Third Avenue. We hope to meet a happy, thoughtful, professional married couple for this purpose.

Please write to us if this seems an arrangement you may be interested in. Please also feel free to share any information or advice on this subject that you may have. We would very much appreciate it.

Nanny for Fairfield or Westport,https://newyork.craigslist.org/fct/kid/d/nanny-for-fairfield-or/6302168667.html,Fairifeld,"
        
Hi! I started babysitting at 12 and became a teacher and guidance counselor.  I had a special education job last year at a private school but it was challenging as some of the students would scratch and kick and a few teachers got concussions from the autistic kids. I would like to work as a nanny this year. I love to sing, dance, and play sports so I am still a kid at heart but over 35 lol. Please don't contact me if you want me to check out your service or website. I need to speak on the phone to see if this is a real reply. Rate and duties negotiable. I am a very flexible and easy going person who loves kids.  Please let me know the town and ages of your kids and hours needed.

I'm looking for a caregiver in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood to pick up my 7 year old from the school bus drop-off on Wednesdays, Thursdays, and alternate Fridays and babysit for 2-3 hours.

Bus pick-up is at 3:50 PM near our home by the Bed-Stuy YMCA. I return home from work between 6:00 and 6:30 PM. 
I'd like the caregiver to help with homework, prepare snacks, go on trips to local parks, do creative play (arts, crafts), or reading with my second-grader.

The position could be ideal for students from Pratt or St. Joseph's College. Rate is negotiable. References required.

Looking for part time in home nanny (Mon &Wed). Please read entire ad.,https://newyork.craigslist.org/jsy/kid/d/looking-for-part-time-in-home/6302976033.html,North Jersey,"
        
My wife and I have a 4 month old baby girl. I work full time and she is about to go back to work on a part time basis. I would like to see if there is a better option out there besides daycare which is the reason for this ad. We would need a nanny on Mondays and Wednesday to come to our apartment (large apartment complex with doorman, parking garage, children' room, pool, gym etc). The hours would be 8:30 until 5:30 or 6pm. We are looking for someone with all the right certifications and good references.

Here is the twist (and I know this won't be for everyone so please don't respond if your not serious). My wife and I have a don't ask don't tell open relationship, I can have my fun and she can have hers as long as neither has to hear about it (I know that lifestyle isn't for everyone but it works for us). I work from home a decent amount (I am in sales) and wanted to put out a feeler to see if there is someone that meets our requirements as a nanny and would also potentially be open to playing with me (if there is comfort and mutual attraction). It also doesn't have to be sex, and can be something we develop over time. This is not a requirement and obviously the childcare requirements are the most important and comes first over all else. I just want to see if there is someone out there open to the idea should we want to move forward with having a nanny.

We are a young 30 year old couple, I am in finance and also play a semi professional sport. 

I want to find out what the going rate might be for the 2 days we would need you to watch our little one and see if it makes better sense then dropping her off at a daycare. 

If you fit the description above, please respond with a little about you, your certifications, and confirm your openness to the ""twist"". Please also let me know your going rate for your services so I can better compare and determine if it's a better option for me.

If you want to include a picture of yourself then even better. Again I know this opportunity is not going to be everyone's cup of tea so if you don't fit the bill then please refrain from responding.

Exceptional Nanny/babysitter available for part-time childcare


Recently my nanny has gone to a part time schedule
given my littlest daughter entered kindergarten.  She is looking to supplement working with our
family with other babysitting job(s). Her availability is M-F, 7:00 am-1:00 pm. 
Ideally she would like something regular, 2-5 days per week, but ad hoc is not out of the question.  Additionally, she is available for errands, organizing, and other tasks to ease your day to day. 

A little note about our Nanny. She has worked with us for 8 years.  My three daughters, ages 10, 9, and 5, adore her and are extremely attached.   She is kind, caring, responsible, fun, yet appropriately
stern when needed.  Childcare is not a part time gig for her.  Prior to working
with our family, she worked for another family and a day care for a few years.  We trust her explicitly with our children, 2 dogs, vehicle, personal documents, etc.  I think the world of our Nanny and have NO hesitation referring her.

Hi, I have a two-year old and a 5-year old and I'm offering occasional babysitting services. I'm usually free on the weekends (day and night) and sometimes also in the evenings during the week. I live in Astoria, Queens but I can come anywhere in NYC and Westchester (if you live far from public transportation that's ok, as I drive). About me: I'm 34, female, from Europe and have been living in NY since 2008. As a mom of 2 I have done and seen it all. Whatever it is you need, I'll be able to take care of it: cooking, laundry, bathing, putting kids to bed. I enjoy reading to children, offering hugs should they miss you when you're away, playing, outdoors etc. I have no problem taking care of sick children or children with special needs, and I'm ok with pets in the household as well. I have great personal references to provide as well as references from past babysitter jobs.    "

Rock & Roll Manny (Nanny and Babysitter),https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/kid/d/rock-roll-manny-nanny-and/6268079611.html,Lower East Side,"
        
I'm a little less Mary Poppins and a little more School of Rock. More responsible, more experienced, and much cooler than your average manny.

I'm a good fit for kids and parents who think a bit differently. I do have a magna cum laude degree in education, postgraduate study at Columbia, and I've been a nanny for two great families here in the city. But I also listen to lots of music and play bass, guitar, and drums. I draw, play video games and paintball, and play several sports.

Going to the skatepark, jamming with your child on a new song we're learning, and taking him/her and their friends to all-ages afternoon shows are my kind of activities. Of course, this comes alongside the traditional stuff: I can help in all school subjects, I speak three languages, and I know my way around the city, the online world, and the library equally well. Love museums and galleries. Great at handling drama and ""kid crises."" Good with smart kids, unusual kids, and cool kids (all the same thing, as far as I'm concerned).

Best suited for ages 6 and up. Email for further details, including my resume and references.    "

I am very attentive and hands on. I charge $15 per hour. Special flat rates do apply.    "

M & M Day Care was created to offer high quality at home child care services; we foster a creative and caring environment that emphasizes on each child's individual needs.

M & M Day Care fosters an environment in which children of all ages can enjoy learning. If children take pleasure in learning chances of retaining information are greater.  M & M curriculum is designed to simulate the naturally curious minds of children by having a daily activity schedule in place, adequate space, engaging toys and serving nutritional meals. 

M & M staff is caring and nurturing, we understand the importance of creating a gentle and warm setting.  Social and emotional interaction is crucial in children's cognitive development. 

M & M provides a hands-on approach to learning, weather its play-time or feeding time there is always a lesson to be taught.  


We do after school pick up from schools in a .5 mile radius of the day care.

My nanny of 12+ years is seeking a new family starting in the fall in Brooklyn or Manhattan. Nelesia is a warm and awesome nanny, who came to me when my daughter was 4 months old. Nelesia from day one has been a valuable partner in helping raise my daughter into a warm, loving, and respectful young lady. She was a most helpful in helping my daughter adjust during my divorce a few years ago.

Nelesia's Skills

As my daughter's nanny, Nelesia has proven to be versed in the developmental stages of infants and toddlers, while maintaining a high level of professionalism. She has performed the duties of managing all aspects of my daughter's daily routine, which includes, but to not limited to planning and preparing nutritious meals, taking her to appointments and planning indoor and outdoor activities for my daughter that were fun, educational and fit my daughter's needs. 

While we will miss Nelesia very much, I am confident that she will be an asset to your family.

Seeking Nanny Share in Lower Westchester,https://newyork.craigslist.org/wch/kid/d/seeking-nanny-share-in-lower/6296437171.html,Mamaroneck,"
        
Hi,

We are a professional couple with a ten month old baby located in Mamaroneck, Westchester and are seeking a full-time nanny. We are wondering if there are any other families who may need part or full-time care (can be flexible) and are interested in a nanny share, to help alleviate costs and provide the children with companionship.

I will be happy to host in my home, as I mainly work from home and can provide an additional level of supervision.

We have not yet found a nanny, so we can potentially search for one together as well.

Please note, this ad is only for other parents seeking a nanny share situation.    "

Hi im offering childcare services in my home located  near journal square area, only 5 blocks away from path station.My heart is in childcare,I love my job and being a part of their everday life and helping them in every milestone along their journey.
I have plenty of books, board games, videogames  and even outdoor activities

My hours are from 7am to 6pm Monday thru Friday and I'm also available on some weekends.
I'm a mom of 2 kids, a 11 year old girl and a 7 year old boy and I know its hard finding and trusting someone with your child.Coming from a mom I know its never easy but please rest assure I will care for your child as if he/she were one of mine own and will give you the peace of mind you need by sending daily pics of your child as well as calls. My kids go to school until 4pm so I have free time and figured I can contribute to the household by helping other parents out there who are looking for child care.

Hi, 

I'm available for after school babysitting. I have great references. I'm reliable, responsible and willing to help. 
I'm also available during the day for running errands or babysitting as well. 
I charge $15 per hour but since I need to bring my 4 months old baby with me, I'm charging $12. 

I'm bilingual and follow directions well. I hope I can work for you.

Sincerely,

Lucy

Hello. I am a college senior available for babysitting. I have over 7 years of experience babysitting infants to school aged children both for my family members and outside clients. In addition, I have four years experience working as a tutor for children privately as well as in school preparation programs, so I'll make sure your children enjoy doing their homework and learning!

I have taken a semester-long course in First Aid and Safety and have been certified in Basic Life Support which includes pediatric CPR since 2013. I maintain a 3.7 GPA and am soon graduating with a Bachelor's in Chemistry with the intention to apply to medical school. 

I'm willing to assist with cleaning, shopping, laundry, and food preparation while caring for your kids. I am a licensed driver and own a car, so I am more than willing to bring your kids out to the park or playground or other activities to keep them active. I absolutely love all the time that I get to spend around children and am excited to meet some new faces!

Please email me if you are interested in my professional profile or references.    "

Hi Everyone

My name is Lee and I'm a Life Skills Coach for Special Needs children. I'm bilingual English and Spanish and have AED first aid and CPR. I also have a current background check. I am looking for part time work with a toddler or younger as I have experience with these kids also. 

Right now I'm working with 2 children in Windsor Terrace in the mornings and tomorrow will be my last day. One goes back to school and their regular Nanny will pick him up. Currently looking to help another family.

My typical day would consist of going to the library for reading flash cards and socialization. Can take to the museum and the park weather permitting. I can teach Spanish if you'd like. Looking to work in many places. Williamsburg Park Slope UWS LES East Village etc.


My schedule is:

Mondays off

Tuesday's thru Fridays available until 2:30pm.

Available most weekends too.

I'm a warm college educated woman who has a passion for all children and I'm fit and cook healthy meals.

Warm regards, Lee    "

I am 26yrs old and a stay at home mom for my 2 little girls, a 20 month old and a 6 month old .  I have cared for children of all ages for over 10yrs and truly enjoy it.  I am seeking a child care position in my home because I love being home with my girls but my husband and I are in need of a second income.

A normal day for my girls and I would be having breakfast, lunch and dinner with 2 snacks inbetween.  I mostly purchase organic and snacks usually consist of fruit.  We love to play, dance around the house, read books and take walks when the weather is nice.  We do not have any pets and live in a one level home.

If you have any questions please email me and I will get back to you as soon as possible.    "

-Study abroad experience (full year in developing nation)
-Internship at Columbia University

As a manny, I've done light homework help; preparing snacks and basic meals/ordering dinners for the kids and I; helping clean up of messes; reading and educational activities; and fun games and related activities the kids enjoy--Legos, Star Wars, dinosaurs, imaginary games, board games, art and drawing/sketching, to name a few. I strive to create a stable, healthy, and fun environment for the kids and to set a good example and be an inspirational role model. I am a non-smoker, pet-friendly, and am flexible in scheduling.

Please reach out if you would like to know more, and tell me about yourself and what your needs are. The arrangement I am seeking would be a guaranteed 20 hours per week, preferably Monday to Friday sometime around 3 pm to 7 pm give or take. I would be available to help on school holidays and possibly a weekend here or there as long as we scheduled with advanced notice. The age range I am qualified to help with is first graders to teenage years, and I would be most comfortable with one to two kids. Because I live in Manhattan, I do not drive and so would be unable to function as a driver. My longer term goals are to attend grad school, but since that takes one to two years from applying, I'd be able to commit for one to two years.

Lastly, what I am looking for in a family is what I offer as an assistant: trust, respect, generosity, and thoughtfulness. 

Thank you.    "

Lituania's Bio

Hello Parents. I'm a very loving, honest and responsible woman. Why I love to be a nanny? There's nothing in this world more fun than children. I love to teach them so many things and you don't imagine all the things we do on the table doing arts & crafts or when the girls want to do a dress up show or when they start saying their first words in Spanish. They truly fulfill my heart. When you do what you love, it's not a job, it's a blessing.

Jasmin's Bio

Hello! My name is Jasmin. I'm a very artistic and creative person. I am 20 years old and I am a nursing student at New York City College of Technology. I have worked in a daycare as a summer job before, working with children 6 years old playing with them, giving them snacks, taking them to trips to the park and library. I also occasionally babysat my cousins, which is where I gained most of my experience. For one of my cousins I watched over 3 of her children since I was in the 8th grade (ages are 15, 8, and 5 now). My other cousin I babysat her daughter at my house for really late nights, she is 8 years old now, but I watched her when she was a toddler (1-2 years old). I have also volunteered in a school being a teacher's assistant for a kindergarten class grading, testing, and helping the students out with class work, reading, writing, math. I have experience working with other families.    "

I am interested in working as a nanny per diem or on a regular basis. I have worked with children my entire life.

Please indicate the town, the age of your kids, and the type of work you need.  I have lived in Stamford and Fairfield and am willling to consider various areas in Fairfield County.  As this is Craigslist, I don't want to share too much more about myself unless you share about yourself, the job, pay rate, hours needed, and of course your location.   I hope we can chat on the phone after you leave your cell number.  Thank you for your consideration.  I don't like having to use Sitter City or Care.com and pay fees.    "

Hi everyone

My name is Lee and I'm a Special Needs Nanny looking for more work in July. My regular kid will be at a sleep away camp. I have CPR AED and first aid training. I'm also bilingual English and Spanish and have been working with the same family in Park Slope 10 years. Also worked with a toddler who is not Special Needs and worked with a 10 month old who moved out of state. With the toddler it was all about the ABCs flashcards and lots of reading. With the baby it was about the same with reading and play groups. Trips to the park etc.

I have 3 complete background checks as I worked for 2 agencies and work with a third and they require this to work with any child. Background was passed 3/2017 Medicaid requires it. Also got company evaluation where I was observed working with child and got great evaluation! (will show you). I am a warm Nanny who has a passion for all kids not just special needs and love cooking healthy meals and exercising.

We are an experienced entertainment company with over 20 years of experience serving Suffolk and Nassau Counties looking to add more wonderful people to our staff. We have a great opportunity for you to make money and have fun doing it. You must enjoy working with children, be energetic and be ready to have fun. If this interests you, please read everything below and then apply! We are looking for full year staff. Our company really makes sure we take care of our staff. The pay is $30 per hour event, $45 per 90 minute performance, and $60 per two hour event plus tips. This is great money and a wonderful source of income for college students or people looking to make a little extra money on the weekend. You must be available both Saturday and Sunday, responsible and have reliable transportation (we do travel to Suffolk and Nassau). We alternate driving responsibilities and reimburse gas for distances over thirty minutes.


Job Description: Your duties will include dancing, face painting, playing games with young children, performing for a crowd, etc. You will be trained in both jobs and will do both as needed. We are a full service entertainment company with fifteen years of experience and owned by two teachers. We are based in the Smithtown area in Suffolk County NY.


This is a really fun job working with children. It is also great experience to put on a teaching resume. It helped my wife and I to both get our teaching positions. We are willing to pay a good price and we have an excellent reputation in the entertainment industry. We are extremely fair people who are great to work with and for. We currently have a great staff of people but we are adding more parties so we need to increase our staff. This is a great job to supplement your income. It is usually one to two days a week so it is a part-time position, but has great potential.

Right now, the warm weather is here it is extremely busy and it will be busy and there will also be additional weekday opportunities if you are interested.



Are you looking for a fun job working with children? We are looking to hire entertainers (female only at this time) to be party assistants and characters for children's parties (you must be willing to do both).

Pay is $30 per hour event plus tips, $45 for 1 ½ hr. events plus tips and $60 for a 2 hr. event plus tips. We pay considerably more than other entertainment companies and that is why our current staff is so good and has stayed with us for a long time. We do not hire high school students (our current staff ranges in age from early 20's-early 30's). If you are outgoing and have experience with children-we want you! Serious inquiries only!

Your Name
Address (or town you are based from)

Education

Types of events that you would like to work

Hello Parents:

I am a licensed childcare provider with the Dept. of Health for 14 years.  I take care of children from ages 2 months-5 years old.  I have 2 spots open for ages 2 years -5 years old, I am not accepting after school (6-12 years old).  I am in the food program so all meals are free.  I have other certificates in Shaken Baby Syndrome, Sudden Infant Death, and Child Abuse & Maltreatment.  I am also CPR and First Aid Certified.

I accept HRA, ACD, and Private (cash), will give receipts with every payment and I do have a tax identification number for your taxes.  I also have HRA vouchers to take to your worker.

I open all shifts, just tell me what days and hours you need care for...we can negotiate.
I open at 5:00 am-until ?



This is not a 24 hour daycare, and I am not hiring!!!!

The new market rate for childcare went up June 1, 2016...find it on the UFT website.

I live across from Lincoln Hospital and the #32 bus stops in front of this building.  Other transportation are the #2, #4, #5, trains to E. 149th st and Grand Concourse , #6 train to E. 138th steet 3rd Ave., and #21bus, #19Bus at E. 143rd & Third ave. or E. 149th St. Morris Ave.

If you're interested, please feel free to call me at 
 
 (not a cell) Home ask for Arlene,  I can give you full address on day of interview, I will not post my address on Craigslist.
I have contracts for us to sign.

Thank You
Arlene 2017    "
